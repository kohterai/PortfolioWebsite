        <h1>Envisioning Information</h1>
        <h2>Edward R. Tufte</h2>
        <h3>October 4, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Envisioning Information is an inspirational book of how much love can be given to a seemingly dull subject. Tufte gives us ingenious examples of how multidimensional data has been represented on paper by different people in different subject areas throughout time. We see similar recurring strategies that are used for completely unrelated datasets. Tufte takes the reader on a journey, comparing and studying different data visualization strategies used.</p>

    <p>The best moments in the book are when Tufte gives bad examples of design, then presents us with a fixed version. He articulates the differences very clearly for the reader. Although the changes seem trivial and obvious (once presented with), the differences are stark. You can really tell the difference between work that someone “just doing their job” created opposed to an artful production of seemingly boring data. Tufte does this repeatedly with timetables for trains from all around the world and from centuries ago. These range from ingenious forms of time table presentation invented by Charles Ybry to “ordinary” timetables in the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.</p>

    <p>This book also has a fair amount of examples from Japan, mainly train timetables. The book provides English translations but I also found it entertaining to be able to read and understand a lot of the original captions on the Japanese examples.</p>

    <p>Some things must be mentioned about the physical production of the book. The typesetting and design of this book is uncomfortably perfect. All of the diagrams, images, and examples are presented in the same page as the accompanying text. In typical books, descriptions and paragraphs overflow to the following page, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to compare the text and illustrations. Text is always contained within a single spread, perfectly compartmentalizing each spread by a separate topic (unless a topic spans multiple spreads). Margins on each page are cleverly used to accompany footnotes and images. The choice of materiality for the hardcover edition is also incredible. The heavy paper used in the book makes every page feel it is filled with importance. It is the kind of paper you want to flip carefully, as not to damage the pages. This makes the physical act of flipping each page a conscious one, requiring the reader to carefully delve deeper into the book. Envisioning Information itself is a masterpiece of presenting information.</p>

    <p>Galileos examples of discovering Jupiter’s moons, as well as graphical train timetables were my favorite part of the book. I would love to read his other books in the future as well.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Tufte gives us examples and strategies of converting multi-dimensional data into the world of the “flatland” (2D, paper). He gives us examples throughout history where artists, scientists, statisticians, have used various techniques to represent time, space, magnitude, and other qualitative factors on paper. The book makes clear what techniques work, and what doesn’t, and includes some psychological reasoning to back theories up. The book is dense with examples and references about data visualization throughout history and industries.</p>

        <h1>Speculative Everything - Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming</h1>
        <h2>Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby</h2>
        <h3>October 1, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Speculative Everything is not only about building imaginary products for future societies. Dunne and Raby broaden the scope of speculative design much further. Speculative works can encompass not only future worlds, but also parallel worlds and improbable futures. By not concentrating on profitability, designers can be more imaginative than ever. The value of a successful speculative design project should be measured by how thought provoking it is. Imagination into other possible societies, values, and ways of living, can also give us introspection into the society we live in right now.</p>

    <p>The book also goes into more practical advice for creating speculative works. It talks about how if a speculative work were too far fetched from our current world, it would be impossible for viewers to relate to it. On the other hand, if it a design were too familiar to what we would find commercially available, it wouldn’t courage viewers to enter an imaginative state. Striking a fine line between the real and the unreal is key to a successful speculative design project.<p>

    <p>By creating works that are thought provoking of possible futures, or alternative ways of living, there is a possibility that those speculations may influence how our future with shape. The book sees speculative design as a possible catalyst for social, economic, environmental, and aesthetic change. Much of today's commercial works are bound by realistic expectations and do not allow space for imagination. Speculative design is introduced as a tool to provoke thoughts, and completely reimagining how things are.</p>

    <p>The writing is unclear and hard to follow for someone new to the field of speculative design. Unlike Sapiens, which is written for anyone, speculative everything seems to be geared towards an audience already acquainted with the field and wants more references and inspiration. Many examples of works are mentioned throughout the book but often unaccompanied with any description. Even if they are accompanied with images, they usually only have a sentence or two to accompany them making if very difficult to understand what the project is about. Perhaps information is intentionally left out to make the reader “imagine” about what the work is about.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Speculative Everything introduces us to the field of speculative design. We are introduced to speculative works in other mediums such as literature, cinema, fashion, and painting. Through this, Dunne and Raby describe the uniqueness that the field of design could bring to speculative projects. The book is filled with many examples of speculative design (mostly from their students at Royal College of Art) and examples of speculative works from other mediums. The book articulates the value of speculative works, even if they are not produced as profitable items.</p>

        <h1>Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind</h1>
        <h2>Yuval Noah Harari</h2>
        <h3>September 10, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This book gave me an opportunity to rethink what it means to be human. We have gotten so used to being “humans” that we sometimes forget that we are merely animals. Harari takes us through a journey from when Humans lived amongst other animals in the nature to our lives on modern day Earth. Reading about such past times makes you realize that so many of the rules, expectations, and mechanisms that dictate our lives today are creations of our imaginations (or myths as Harari would say).</p>

    <p>One of the main themes throughout the book is how our genetic structure has remained more of less the same since the first Homo Sapiens 150,000 years ago but how our society has evolved radically throughout history. Based on how humans use their collective imaginations, they have the power to completely change the way we live and function. The book takes a rather objective stance on various myths humans have believe with in the past. This made me think about the myths that we believe in today, and how these beliefs that make society function and not permanent nor absolute as much as they present themselves to be.<p>

    <p>One of my favorite takeaways in this book is the concept of inter-subjective truths. Unlike objective truths (eg. Gravity will attract object with a mass) and subjective truths (eg. Bob thinks that yesterday’s rain was caused by him stepping on an ant), inter-subjective truths are collective imaginations that exists in more than one body (eg. law, money, gods, nations) (ch. 6, Building Pyramids). Once you can identify something as an inter-subjective truth, it means that you can decide to believe in it or not with deliberation. This also gives you the ability to respect, empathize, and live amongst those who believe in different inter-subjective truths than yourself.</p>

    <p>It's an extremely fascinating book that's thought provoking in many ways. Great read, captivating from the first chapter.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Sapiens is a historical journey of the evolution of humans starting from when Homo Sapiens (“us”) used to live around other human speices such as Homo erectus and Homo soloensis. We are brought back to a world where we used to live amongst other animals. We follow the expansion of humans throughout the entire planet and see how we devised fictive creations to help keep order amongst our species. This book covers a wide range of topics, from religion, politics, ideologies, finance, biology, physics, law, and ethics.</p>
