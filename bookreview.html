    <h1>Speculative Everything - Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming</h1>
    <h2>Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby</h2>
    <h3>October 1, 2017</h3>

    <p>Speculative Everything is not only about building imaginary products for future societies. Dunne and Raby broaden the scope of speculative design much further. Speculative works can encompass not only future worlds, but also parallel worlds and improbable futures. By not concentrating on profitability, designers can be more imaginative than ever. The value of a successful speculative design project should be measured by how thought provoking it is. Imagination into other possible societies, values, and ways of living, can also give us introspection into the society we live in right now.</p>

    <p>The book also goes into more practical advice for creating speculative works. It talks about how if a speculative work were too far fetched from our current world, it would be impossible for viewers to relate to it. On the other hand, if it a design were too familiar to what we would find commercially available, it wouldn’t courage viewers to enter an imaginative state. Striking a fine line between the real and the unreal is key to a successful speculative design project.<p>

    <p>By creating works that are thought provoking of possible futures, or alternative ways of living, there is a possibility that those speculations may influence how our future with shape. The book sees speculative design as a possible catalyst for social, economic, environmental, and aesthetic change. Much of today's commercial works are bound by realistic expectations and do not allow space for imagination. Speculative design is introduced as a tool to provoke thoughts, and completely reimagining how things are.</p>

    <p>The writing is unclear and hard to follow for someone new to the field of speculative design. Unlike Sapiens, which is written for anyone, speculative everything seems to be geared towards an audience already acquainted with the field and wants more references and inspiration. Many examples of works are mentioned throughout the book but often unaccompanied with any description. Even if they are accompanied with images, they usually only have a sentence or two to accompany them making if very difficult to understand what the project is about. Perhaps information is intentionally left out to make the reader “imagine” about what the work is about.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Speculative Everything introduces us to the field of speculative design. We are introduced to speculative works in other mediums such as literature, cinema, fashion, and painting. Through this, Dunne and Raby describe the uniqueness that the field of design could bring to speculative projects. The book is filled with many examples of speculative design (mostly from their students at Royal College of Art) and examples of speculative works from other mediums. The book articulates the value of speculative works, even if they are not produced as profitable items.</p>

    <h1>Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind</h1>
    <h2>Yuval Noah Harari</h2>
    <h3>September 10, 2017</h3>

    <p>This book gave me an opportunity to rethink what it means to be human. We have gotten so used to being “humans” that we sometimes forget that we are merely animals. Harari takes us through a journey from when Humans lived amongst other animals in the nature to our lives on modern day Earth. Reading about such past times makes you realize that so many of the rules, expectations, and mechanisms that dictate our lives today are creations of our imaginations (or myths as Harari would say).</p>

    <p>One of the main themes throughout the book is how our genetic structure has remained more of less the same since the first Homo Sapiens 150,000 years ago but how our society has evolved radically throughout history. Based on how humans use their collective imaginations, they have the power to completely change the way we live and function. The book takes a rather objective stance on various myths humans have believe with in the past. This made me think about the myths that we believe in today, and how these beliefs that make society function and not permanent nor absolute as much as they present themselves to be.<p>

    <p>One of my favorite takeaways in this book is the concept of inter-subjective truths. Unlike objective truths (eg. Gravity will attract object with a mass) and subjective truths (eg. Bob thinks that yesterday’s rain was caused by him stepping on an ant), inter-subjective truths are collective imaginations that exists in more than one body (eg. law, money, gods, nations) (ch. 6, Building Pyramids). Once you can identify something as an inter-subjective truth, it means that you can decide to believe in it or not with deliberation. This also gives you the ability to respect, empathize, and live amongst those who believe in different inter-subjective truths than yourself.</p>

    <p>It's an extremely fascinating book that's thought provoking in many ways. Great read, captivating from the first chapter.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Sapiens is a historical journey of the evolution of humans starting from when Homo Sapiens (“us”) used to live around other human speices such as Homo erectus and Homo soloensis. We are brought back to a world where we used to live amongst other animals. We follow the expansion of humans throughout the entire planet and see how we devised fictive creations to help keep order amongst our species. This book covers a wide range of topics, from religion, politics, ideologies, finance, biology, physics, law, and ethics.</p>
