    <h1>Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind</h1>
    <h2>Yuval Noah Harari</h2>
    <h3>September 10, 2017</h3>

    <p>This book gave me an opportunity to rethink what it means to be human. We have gotten so used to being “humans” that we sometimes forget that we are merely animals. Harari takes us through a journey from when Humans lived amongst other animals in the nature to our lives on modern day Earth. Reading about such past times makes you realize that so many of the rules, expectations, and mechanisms that dictate our lives today are creations of our imaginations (or myths as Harari would say).</p>

    <p>One of the main themes throughout the book is how our genetic structure has remained more of less the same since the first Homo Sapiens 150,000 years ago but how our society has evolved radically throughout history. Based on how humans use their collective imaginations, they have the power to completely change the way we live and function. The book takes a rather objective stance on various myths humans have believe with in the past. This made me think about the myths that we believe in today, and how these beliefs that make society function and not permanent nor absolute as much as they present themselves to be.<p>

    <p>One of my favorite takeaways in this book is the concept of inter-subjective truths. Unlike objective truths (eg. Gravity will attract object with a mass) and subjective truths (eg. Bob thinks that yesterday’s rain was caused by him stepping on an ant), inter-subjective truths are collective imaginations that exists in more than one body (eg. law, money, gods, nations) (ch. 6, Building Pyramids). Once you can identify something as an inter-subjective truth, it means that you can decide to believe in it or not with deliberation. This also gives you the ability to respect, empathize, and live amongst those who believe in different inter-subjective truths than yourself.</p>

    <p>It's an extremely fascinating book that's thought provoking in many ways. Great read, captivating from the first chapter.</p>

    <p>Summary: Sapiens is a historical journey of the evolution of humans starting from when Homo Sapiens (“us”) used to live around other human speices such as Homo erectus and Homo soloensis. We are brought back to a world where we used to live amongst other animals. We follow the expansion of humans throughout the entire planet and see how we devised fictive creations to help keep order amongst our species. This book covers a wide range of topics, from religion, politics, ideologies, finance, biology, physics, law, and ethics.</p>
