        <h1>難しいことはわかりませんが、お金の増やし方を教えてください！</h1>
        <h2>Hajime Yamazaki and Kosuke Ohashi</h2>
        <h3>March 23, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This book is a conversation between Ohashi, who is a novice at investing, and Yamazaki who is a veteran in finance. Ohashi asks Yamazaki very basic questions about investing and Yamazaki answers them as honestly and straightforward as possible.</p>

    <p>This book is far more practical than <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>. Graham's book is more about the right investing mindset rather than specific financial products.  On the other hand, this book is incredibly practical. Yamazaki describes exactly which financial products to buy and goes as far as showing the steps of how to register an account at online brokerages and buy the products discussed.</p>

    <p>The book mainly recommends index funds and government bonds. Yamazaki also makes it very clear which financial products to stay away from. For example, large retail banks in Japan run many TV ads for their fund wrap products. Yamazaki makes a very strong point to stay away from these products since returns are minimized because of the high costs of running advertisements, having commercial retail spaces, and high salaries of bankers. Instead, Yamazaki recommends readers to buy most financial products through online brokerages, since their overall expenses for running the business is lower, so investors can expect higher returns.</p>

    <p>A lot of the discussion is Japan-specific. NISA is brought up many times, which is a tax exemption scheme in Japan to encourage more people to invest. Also, some chapters don't concern investing directly. For example, there is some discussion about the financial benefits of marrying, or whether you should have life insurance, and what kind of life insurance makes the most sense financially. There is also a chapter discussing whether you should rent or buy your own house.</p>

    <p>Ohashi's naive questions makes the book approachable to the ordinary reader while Yamazaki's expertise brings credibility and clarity to the answers given. This was a very light book to read, especially after reading <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>.</p>

        <h1>The Intelligent Investor</h1>
        <h2>Benjamin Graham</h2>
        <h3>March 18, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is the first book about investing I’ve read. Graham teaches the readers the philosophy and techniques about value investing. A lot of the book is about having the right attitude towards investing.</p>

    <p>Graham makes a strong distinction between investors and speculators. Often, people think that they are investing when they are merely speculating. Although Graham does not deny that speculators can make great returns at times, he also makes the claim that in the long term, speculators usually end up losing more money than the “intelligent investor”.</p>

    <p>My technical knowledge of investing is limited. I do not have an intuitive understanding of concepts like “earnings per share” or different types of bonds. For this reason, a lot of the technical chapters of the book were very difficult for me to read. At the same time, the chapters about general investment philosophies were easy to understand. I think that if someone with a technical knowledge of investing reads the book, they may have a lot to gain from it.</p>

    <p>Graham is realistic and empathetic about understanding what kind of investor you are. The biggest distinction he makes is between the “Defensive Investor” and the “Enterprising Investor”. He does not make a claim that one is superior to the other but instead makes a distinction based on how much of a commitment you are willing to put into your investments. If you don’t enjoy reading financial reports and doing research for picking the right stocks, he respects that and gives proper advice towards that kind of investor.</p>

    <p>The revised edition of The Intelligent Investor includes commentaries written by Jason Zweig, a finance journalist after every chapter. For chapters that are unclear because of Graham’s writing style or technical lingo, Zweig summarizes in a manner that is easy to understand. In addition, he also adds a modern interpretation to Graham’s writing. Since the original book was written in 1973, to a novice reader like myself, it is unclear if the numbers or the philosophy that Graham talks about is still relevant in today’s market. Zweig’s commentaries and footnotes let me know if something is out of date, or if specific market conditions have changed. The commentary felt very necessary for me to read the book without being worried how relevant Graham’s writing still is.</p>

    <p>I’m glad that I read this book at an early age before I begin investing any money. This book has motivated me to look at the market in the long term, and makes you realize how much the market fluctuates over long periods. Since I am still young, I don’t need to concentrate on making quick returns. Zweig talks quite a bit about how things went out of hand during the dot-com bubble. Since I didn’t live though the dot-com bubble, I found it quite fascinating to read about what happened there, and I feel educated for when another bubble comes.</p>

    <p>There are three ideologies that stuck with me the most. First, the ideology that just because the market declines, you need to sell your stocks. Second, that when there is a “growth stock” it actually makes the stock more dangerous to invest in it since there’s a greater chance that it is overvalued due to the high enthusiasm of the market. Thirdly, that it is very difficult to recover from huge losses, so you want to avoid that as much as possible.</p>

    <p>On a side note, Graham dedicates a chapter to the dangers of inflation. I recently visited an audio company and they had on display an old record player from decades ago. The price of the record player was 35 yen. It’s scary to think that there was a time it was possible to buy a fancy record player for 1/3 the price of a notebook.</p>

    <p><i>The Intelligent Investor</i> took quite a long time for me to read, and some parts were quite tough for me to get through. Overall I feel it was a necessary book for me to read and I’m glad that I got through it. Now that I have a general understanding of the value investing mindset, I would like to read more technical books investing next.</p>

        <h1>Digital Gold</h1>
        <h2>Nathaniel Popper</h2>
        <h3>February 1, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Digital Gold</i> is a story about the creation of Bitcoin from a historic and cultural perspective, as opposed to a technical standpoint. I did not expect much before reading this book but the content was incredibly captivating, and provided a great summary of the development of Bitcoin. I’ve only become acquainted with Bitcoin in the past few years but this book tells a story starting in 2009. Prior to reading <i>Digital Gold</i> I had no idea what Bitcoin was about other than all the speculation that was happening with its prices.</p>

    <p>It seems like people with anarchistic motives and ideologies drove the beginnings of Bitcoin. Although the beginning years potentially sounded like a startup in its early phases, it seemed more about spreading a belief and an ideology. Like any other currency, Bitcoin needed its users to have trust in it. In order to spread the Bitcoin, the early adopters needed people to believe in it at an ideological level. The early years of the Bitcoin story is filled with such passionate people who did this with no intention of becoming rich. I find this passion incredibly inspiring. Reading about so many people who were excited by the new possibilities has made me excited as well.</p>

    <p>The truth is, I still don’t quite understand the true powers of Bitcoin and the blockchain, but I am filled with excitement about it now, and want to read more about the subject. The book repeatedly quotes people who claim that the Bitcoin is like the Internet when the Internet first came out. Even to this day, people are still finding new ways of embracing Internet. If Bitcoin really is the “next internet” I really do want to understand what its all about. There are probably lots of projects that are low hanging fruit and I would like to be able to understand this enough to identify these opportunities.</p>

    <p>Finally there is one quote that stuck with me about the relationship between Bitcoin and blockchain. Wences Casares, one of the leading Bitcoin entrepreneurs said, “The desire to use the blockchain without Bitcoin was like somebody wanting to have a website without using the Internet.” (p. 365) There is something about this quote that fascinates me, and makes me realize that I know so little about this new technology.</p>

        <h1>Global Economic History - A Very Short Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Robert C. Allen</h2>
        <h3>January 27, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I decided to read this book because I had Professor Allen as my economics professor during my last semester in university. Reading the book reminded me of many of the concepts that we discussed in class, most notably the relationship between high wages and inventions as well as the importance of investigating the historical prices of different goods to tell economic stories.</p>

    <p>The book discusses the different types of economic development that took place from the 18th century onwards in different parts of the world. Professor Allen first introduces what is known as the Great Divergence, why the west experienced tremendous economic growth while the rest of the countries were left behind. The ‘standard model’ of industrialization is described, which includes the four policies that effect banking, tariffs, education, and transport. Throughout the book we see how these four policies were successfully or unsuccessfully applied to different countries over the past four centuries.</p>

    <p>I found the chapter about the economic growth of Africa particularly interesting. The chapter starts off explaining, “Colonial ideology persists in some Western circles, where the poverty of Africans is attributed to their imagined laziness of lack of intelligence. ” (p.91) Instead of conforming to these types of stereotypical explanations, Professor Allen attempts to give a purely economic explanation to why economic growth did not reach the levels of Western counterparts. Some of the reasons include aftereffects from colonial rule, high transportation costs to Europe, as well as having too much land, which prevented a series of developments from having to taking place. A whole chapter is dedicated to this mystery about African growth and goes quite in depth.</p>

    <p>In addition to chapters about Africa, there is also emphasis on China, Japan, and Russia, as examples of countries that successfully adopted the standard model and also were able to catch up to the West due to careful policy planning for the “Big Push” industrialization. Although I take for granted the current state of Japan, the book makes it clear that exuberant amounts of investments and planning needed to be made in order to transform the country into a modern industrial economy. The success is a result of a long-term project, and I find that kind of future planning inspiring and respectable. Although most people never get to engage in state planning of that scale, it is quite fascinating to read about it and to get a glimpse of the complexity behind it.</p>

Although most people never get to engage in state planning of that scale, it is quite fascinating to read about it and to get a glimpse of the complexity behind it. The book has made me feel that the causes of inequality are much more complicated than I expected, and that it feels like a product of circumstances more than anything.</p>

    <p>My main criticism about the book is that some of the graphs are hard to read since the keys are often similar.</p>

    <p><b>Terminology:</b> Great Divergence, Big Push Industrialization, standard model, MES - Minimum Efficient Size</p>

        <h2>AXIS Magazine</h2>
        <h3>January 14, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I was at the <a href="https://www.balmuda.com/jp/" target="_blank">Balmuda</a> section inside <a href="http://real.tsite.jp/futakotamagawa/english/" target="_blank">Tsutaya Electronics</a> at Futakotamagawa when I saw this magazine on display as a part of promoting the Balmuda products. The magazine was quite beat up since it had been on display for a very long time but I decided to buy the copy never the less.</p>

    <p>This is the first AXIS issue I’ve read. Although the issue was published over 6 months ago, the content did not feel out of date. The main subject was about companies and people that are combining Business, Technology, and Creativity (BTC). In addition the top story was about Balmuda’s founder Gen Terao and his story about the company. I found most of the stories quite fresh and inspiring. One of the articles I found inspiring was on Lena Okajima who founded ALE. <a href="http://star-ale.com/en/" target="_blank">ALE</a> is a Japanese startup attempting to launch satellites to create artificial shooting stars. The story about Balmuda was also inspiring. I learned that Terao used to be a musician and studied industrial design by himself.</p>

    <p>The great part about AXIS is that all of the Japanese articles come translated in English as well. Since the translations are not perfect and sometimes abbreviated, I read most of the articles in Japanese and English to get the most out of each story. I enjoyed the magazine and would love to read future issues as well. It is a great way to get a digest of people and organizations working on innovative design projects.</p>

        <h1>Cosmic Atlas (宇宙の地図)</h1>
        <h2>Eiichirō Kokubo and Miyama Shōken</h2>
        <h3>January 5, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Two astronomers from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan wrote <i>Cosmic Atlas</i>. The concept of the book is very similar to the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)" target="_blanl"><i>Powers of Ten</i></a> by <i>Charles and Ray Eames</i>. We start off at an aerial view of the National Astronomical Observatory in Mitaka, Tokyo and start zooming out in multiples an order of magnitude of 10. We see the Earth, then nearby planets, and eventually out into the whole Cosmos.</p>

    <p>The book is packed with beautiful photos and illustrations of the cosmos. Unlike Carl Sagan’s <i>Cosmos</i>, the book has many illustrations but very little writing. It is a book for “seeing” rather than “reading”. The illustrations are colorful and stunning, and made me imagine what else is out there. The photos range from planets, individual stars, nebulas, and to galaxies. Although the illustrations and photographs were static snapshots in time, I was curious to see how they would look like in motion. Although it would take millions and billions of years to see significant changes in the shapes of the galaxies, I was curious to see this movement in fast motion. To imagine that these astronomical entities change shape over time makes them seem like living organisms.</p>

        <h1>Cosmos</h1>
        <h2>Carl Sagan</h2>
        <h3>January 5, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Cosmos</i> takes us on an adventure though the history of the cosmos, how galaxies where made, where atoms came from, the creation of stars and planets, and how living creatures like humans came to be. Sagan puts Earth and humans in perspective of the cosmos.</p>

    <p><i>Cosmos</i> makes you realize how tiny Earth is when compared to the vastness of everything else out there. In fact, the cosmos is so vast that it even makes our Milky Way seems so small and insignificant. We are small not only physically, but also existed for a short amount of time. In the 14 billion year history of the cosmos, humans have only existed for less than 200,000 years (>0.001% of the existence of the cosmos). Not only are we small, but also we are so young.</p>

    <p>The book is written in a way that an average reader can appreciate and understand the beauty of the cosmos. With that said, I felt that some prior knowledge of space and science would help readers appreciate the concepts more. Although explanations are given, it is hard to digest everything when there are lots of new concepts introduced. For example, there are parts of the book where Sagan delves into the molecular composition of different planets and stars. Since my background in Chemistry is limited, it was rather difficult for me to appreciate those sections and I felt that a lot of what I was reading didn’t register in me.</p>

    <p>The beauty of the book is that it not only concentrates on the science behind cosmos but also takes historical, anthropological, and theological points of views. For example when Sagan examines the possible origins of the cosmos, he makes references to different religions and how scientific explanations may in fact be not much different from many religious creation narratives.</p>

    <p>Reading stories of before the Earth was circumnavigated made me imagine how exciting and scary travel must have been. There were many brave adventurers who sailed the seas to uncover the unknown. With no more “undiscovered” parts left on Earth it is quite clear that if humans still have an inkling of adventure left in them, the next destination would be into space. Sagan talks from his own experiences from the Viking and Voyager missions about people attempting to make these new explorations.</p>

    <p>I personally loved the last three chapters titled “The Persistence of Memory”, “Encyclopedia Galactica”, and “Who Speaks for Earth”. After we are told our place in the cosmos, Sagan discusses the unique qualities of humans and how we are at critical point in our history where we are fully capable of annihilating ourselves through nuclear war. If this happens, it means that our species would not have been able to survive long enough to discover or be discovered by extraterrestrial life. In addition, Sagan talks about the odds of there actually being extraterrestrial life, and how the human species should be dealing with that.</p>

    <p>The possibility of there being life out there is exciting. But I personally think that humans may still lack the maturity to properly interact with them. How can we expect ourselves to treat extraterrestrial life forms with respect, when we cannot treat other species of animals on Earth properly and moreover, treat other humans fairly.</p>

    <p>When compared to <i>Sapiens</i>, this book is much more scientific and less speculative. I do feel that the underlying spirit of the books is similar, in that they attempt to place humans in perspective of time and space.</p>

    <p>My biggest criticism for the book is that I wish it had more accompanying diagrams and photos. A lot of the new concepts were incredibly foreign to me so I was very curious to actually see what Sagan was describing. For example Sagan talks about a large radio telescope called the Very Large Array. I had to imagine what it looked like until I had the Internet to look it up.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> <i>Cosmos</i> is a book about the history of the cosmos, galaxies, stars, planets, as well as origins of life on Earth. Sagan also goes into the history of the study of astronomy, possibilities of extraterrestrial life, and our brief history as humans.</p>

    <p><i>Branded Interactions</i> is about the intersection of branding and design. Spies describes how a unique and cohesive user experience is vital in order to create a strong brand in today’s digital world. My understanding of branding prior to reading this book was of corporate visual identities (including colors, typography, logo). Spies has expanded my understanding and appreciation of branding to a new level.</p>

    <p>Users now have more opportunities to come in contact with a brand than ever before. This includes websites, emails, apps, interactive installations, hardware, etc…. Each of these “brand touchpoints” must be understood and designed appropriately to supplement a given brand. This means that a brand should have cohesive gestures, navigation systems, and levels of complexities. Even if they are not identical across mediums, all interactions should be in line with the brand strategy.</p>

    <p>The books takes you through a 5 step process of “discovery”, “define”, “design”, “deliver”, “distribute” to give a full overview of how a design team may tackle a branded interaction design project.</p>

    <p>Here is an overview of the 5 sections.</p>

    <p><i>Discovery</i>: Techniques for understanding the client, client’s business, users, and their existing brand. Strategies for interviewing stakeholders, analyzing users, understanding the evaluating the brand, evaluating competitors, and defining project goals are given. The discovery stage is about setting up the project so that it is headed towards the right direction. This is the “research” phase of the project.</p>

    <p><i>Define</i>: Based on the findings from the discovery stage a tangible strategy is created. This means mapping our user journeys, positing the brand within the market, planning a user experience, and defining metrics for success.</p>

    <p><i>Design</i>: The design phase is actually about generating ideas, creating wireframes, wireflows, storyboards, and prototyping different designs. This is the actual creation of a design/product based on the “discovery” and “design” phases.</p>

    <p><i>Deliver</i>: This stage is about getting ready for launching the design and product created in the “design” phase. There is a lot of emphasis on creating style guides, both visual and UX guides for the client for when the project gets handed over to a different team.</p>

    <p><i>Distribute</i>: Everything that happens after the launch. This includes measuring KPIs and techniques for a successful debriefing session. Techniques for keeping the brand alive and adaptive are also given. This means having protocols to help new employees understand the brand, but also making sure that the brand gets refined and optimized overtime.</p>

    <p>This book is incredibly practical from how to take notes, team management techniques, team composition, presentation tips, maintaining client relationships, and also setting appropriate metrics for success. The section I appreciated the most was section 3.2 about generating ideas. Spies gives ideas for idea generation and lists good practices based on his experiences of what worked and didn’t work for him in the past. One major practicality that the book leaves out is about pricing/financing strategies for the projects.</p>

    <p>There are several sections of interviews conducted with various designers. Each designer brings a different perspective from his or her previous work. Some interviews lean towards UX and others towards branding. These interviews are refreshing to read in-between the chapters.</p>

    <p>My main criticism for the book is about the graphics that accompany many of the concepts. Often times they are over simplified and feel like they were over designed for the sake design and add confusion (Tufte would not approve of many of the diagrams). Also there are several invented terms and frameworks that may be unfamiliar to most readers.</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b>: How to conduct a successful a branded interaction design (BIxD) project from start to finish. The book is a practical guide to BIxD but also introduces readers to the field and describes why it is important to brands today.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts</b>: Branded Interaction Design (BIxD), wireflows, hierarchy of needs, multiscreen strategies, brand touchpoints, UX style guide, 6-3-5 method for idea generation</p>

        <h1>Visual Explanations</h1>
        <h2>Edward Tufte</h2>
        <h3>November 25, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Similar to <i>Envisioning Information</i>, <i>Visual Explanations</i> is filled with a vast range of examples throughout history and cultures. With that said some of the chapters were confusing and lacked the clarity that <i>Envisioning Information</i> maintained throughout the entire book. The most confusing of them all was the chapter about visual confections. Tufte describes confections as bringing images together to display visual information as opposed to collages, which combine images to create provoking images (art). Tufte attempts to explain the distinction, but without clarity.</p>

    <p>The best chapter of the book is Chapter 2 which goes into extreme detail about one case when information design worked and another case when information design failed. The two examples are from the Cholera Epidemic in London in 1854 and the Space Shuttle Challenger O-ring leak. This chapter is self-contained and should be read by anyone that works with any form of statistics or data visualization. This chapter is not only for people that create visualizations but also for people that read any form of data. Minor tweaks to data visualization can change the entire story so it is important to know these techniques so that one can protect themselves from exploitation (and exploit when necessary).</p>

    <p>There is a chapter dedicated to Parallelism and also in multiples. These techniques are familiar from <i>Envisioning Information</i> but Tufte does a good job of keeping the examples fresh. Also similar to <i>Envisioning Information</i>, one of my most enjoyable moments are when Tufte does a before/after of poor design. These examples help make his principles very clear and prove that they are effective. I found his redesign of cloud animations and aggregation of clinical psychiatric data quite fascinating.</p>

    <p>One chapter is dedicated to visualization of magic tricks. This chapter is strange because first we examine techniques successful magic visualization uses (eg. multiple diagrams in time-sequences, overlapping diagrams, etc.). The chapter moves onto common tricks of deception used in magic (eg. large motions distract from small motions). These techniques of deception are then inverted to talk about positive techniques that can be used to not confuse people. The transition of the chapter from magic diagrams to illusion as a concept was very strange and confusing to me.</p>

    <p>The strange thing about the redesigns, or in fact for any great design are that it makes it seem like there was always a single definitive “best” way to solve a problem. Of course these solutions always seem trivial in afterthought. I think becoming a great designer means to always be able to find a better solution, and to have the capabilities of being able to improve what is already great.</p>

    <p>Although the overall narrative of the book is unclear at times, each of the examples are unique and beautiful. If the reader can form their own interpretations or learnings from them, the book can serve as a great reference for inspiration.</p>

    <p><b>Summary: </b>Tufte shares with us a range of techniques to be able to tell clear effective visual stories of information (data). The book is filled with examples of good designs and explanations of what makes them effective.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts: </b>disinformation design, visual confections, parallelism, bureaucratic structures on computer screen, masking, chart junk</p>

        <h1>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</h1>
        <h2>Matthew Frederick</h2>
        <h3>November 23, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</i> is a short book about attitudes and mindsets when producing architectural works. The list of “101 things” ranges from techniques (sketching, coloring) to presentation to mindsets for producing successful creative works. I think most of the concepts are applicable to other fields of creative works since many of the items are about the importance of process.</p>

    <p>You can tell some of the tips are niche for students of architecture. They are too obscure for an average reader to appreciate. For example tip #22 is “How to make architectural hand-lettering” and explains how to make your handwriting “architectural” style.</p>

    <p>With that said, I think a lot of the concepts which appear to be architecture specific on the surface can be use for non-architectural design. Some of the techniques mentioned in controlling the flow of people throughout a building can be utilized in UX design for screens. Tip #87 is about placing anchors (elements that inherently attract people). By strategically placing anchors that people move between, users can get exposed to and acquainted with everything placed in between. Movement of people can be substituted with movement of the eye.</p>

    <p>I wish the book had more detail and examples, but that would change the purpose of the book. It’s a good book for quick inspiration and reminder for principles.</p>

    <p><b>Summary: </b> List of 101 techniques, philosophies, and attitudes that an architecture student learns. It is a quick and fun read.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts: </b>counterpoint, parti, anchors, solid-void theory</p>

        <h1>Zero to One - Notes on startups, or how to build the future</h1>
        <h2>Peter Thiel</h2>
        <h3>November 15, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Zero to One</i> makes a point that a lot of the developed world lives with an “indefinitely optimistic” attitude. This means that people feel optimistic about the future but without any definite plans regarding how to achieve that. He makes a point that under this kind of mindset, individuals are likely to make decisions that do not create new wealth.</p>

    <p>I feel that the book is great pep talk, but overall it feels like a lot of rambling and heavily opinionated rather than a book written based on years of research and analysis. With that said Thiel has been a part lot of many successful tech startups, and continues to be one of the most influential players so there is a lot to be gained from his intuition and the way he identifies valuable startups. He does make some more constructive and practical advise about starting startups with a partner, or some good philosophies regarding the characteristics of a successful founder.</p>

    <p>This is one of the few business books I read. It’s refreshing to hear some new and radical perspectives. Some of the points are very practical like lists of criteria that a successful startup must take into account (e.g. groundbreaking technology, having a “secret”, etc…). Thiel does dedicate a chapter to the importance of sales and distribution, which was a good reminder that creating a beautiful product is not enough. Some of the more macro thoughts regarding the creation of companies and maintaining a long-term vision seem like important things that a successful entrepreneur must take into account.</p>

    <p>Some of the philosophies regarding successful startups such “own a monopoly” or “know a secret” are good attitudes to approach life as an individual too. It’s great to be the best at something and great to live for values that you alone believe in.</p>


    <p><b>Summary: </b>A book that describes the qualities and attitudes that a successful VC-backed tech startup must take into account.</p>

        <h1>Hello Design Thinking</h1>
        <h2>IDEO U</h2>
        <h3>November 12, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Hello Design Thinking</i> is not a book but an online course offered by the design firm IDEO as an introduction to design thinking.</p>

    <p>The course takes about 90 minutes to complete, and is done all in the browser. The course switches between short video lessons and online activities. For the activities, students are presented with a hypothetical project, and then asked to come up with design ideas to complete the project.</p>

    <p>IDEO divides the course into the 4 sections of Gather Inspiration, Generate Ideas, Make Ideas Tangible, and Share the Story. For each section, they gives us examples of how IDEO approached some of their own client work and shares their techniques and insights with us. For example, in the section of “Generate Ideas” one of the activities is to come up with different ideas of unrelated subjects, and then mixing and matching them to create “innovative”, “out of the box” ideas.</p>

    <p>I do think that this course is a great introduction and a fresh way of thinking for individuals who are not acquainted to this type of work. Design thinking is trendy and IDEO is one of the leading companies behind the movement so I thought that is would be worthwhile to understand their interpretation of the process.</p>

    <p>With that said, I do think that most of the concepts are quite basic for people who have already explored design thinking before. The course is rather expensive ($199 for 90 day access) and for that price you could buy 4 or 5 great books about design. The most valuable parts for me were hearing about actual projects that IDEO completed and how they approached them. This felt like insights that were unique to this course. If someone wants to quickly learn what the process is about, and can expense the course to their company, it may be a fun course to quickly take.</p>

    <p>Since this was the first time I’ve ever bought an online course, I was curious to see how it was implemented, and what the experience feels like. Since the course was advertised as a 90 minutes course, I expected 90 minutes of video, but in reality they had 16 short videos and the rest of the 90 minutes was time for “activities”. I am curious to see how their multi-week courses are structured.</p>

    <p>At the end of the course I received a “design thinking toolkit” which is a 9 page PDF that is a template to walk someone through IDEO’s design thinking process. It is a nice PDF to have but I am also concerned that the process is overly systematized when it is presented like this. If an individual strictly follows this template they may be unable to break out of when necessary, which could cause produce nonoptimal results.</p>

        <h1>The Elements of Typographic Style (version 4.2)</h1>
        <h2>Robert Bringhurst</h2>
        <h3>November 10, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Bringhurst writes to you as if you are a professional. He does not spend time explaining basic typographic concepts from scratch (its not an introductory book). He goes straight to the facts and details so the book can feel heavy at times if you haven’t been exposed to some of these ideas before (or at least thought about them). Bringhurst talks about everything related to typography in extreme detail from its history to its technicalities. The book is not only factual but also approaches typography in a poetic and philosophical manner.</p>

    <p>There is so much substance in the book that answers all the questions that I’ve ever had regarding typography. For example, Bringhurst writes clear rules about whether or not periods (“.”) and commas (“,”) should be included when you are bolding or italicizing text. This is something that I’ve always wondered about.</p>

    <p>Two things really stood out to me that made this book special. First was the amount of typographic history the book contains. By approaching typography from a historical context from when type was casted on metal, it makes you appreciate old decisions made in initial typographic design. Concepts like “leading” and “kerning” can be appreciated more in the context of metal typefaces. Another thing that stood out to me was how international the scope of the book was. He brings into discussion fonts and characters that are non-Latin, especially Cyrillic and Greek characters. There is also a lot of discourse about the right way to approach characters with diacritics that are not used in the traditional English keyboard as å, ä, ă, and â. Diacritics often get neglected when foreign words enter English text.</p>

    <p>One key takeaway was the attitude Bringhurst takes in the importance of tailoring the font to your needs. He has a strong assumption that there is no “perfect” font out there and that every font has space for improvement. He encourages tasks that would seem daunting to the average user such as fixing kerning tables or adding special characters that may not be included in the package.</p>

    <p>By studying typography from a historical context, you realize how carefully crafted the act of typesetting used to be as opposed to now. Today with everyone using word processors on computers, so much of typesetting has become automated and a mindless act. Word processors also give us the tools and power to easily tamper with type, which more often than not causes the average user to make catastrophic decisions. This book makes you realize that there are too many type-crimes around us.</p>

    <p>In a world where so many fonts are available online, Bringhurst brings a great attitude that we should focus more on the quality of fonts than quantity. Too often we end up using fonts that are poorly designed or have an incomplete set of characters. He suggests readers that its better to pick one complete (or almost complete) typefaces, and master it fully before moving onto new typefaces.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> <i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i> gives the readers deep insights into the history, use, and philosophy of typography. The scope of the book is so wide that most of the concepts discussed throughout the book can be applied to typography for any language. It makes you appreciate the intricacies and care that can be put into good typography at another dimension.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts:</b> text figures, tilting figures, ligatures, em, en, digital hints, unicameral, bicameral, slab serif, roman letter</p>

        <h1>How to Lie with Statistics</h1>
        <h2>Darrell Huff</h2>
        <h3>October 15, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>How to Lie with Statistics</i> introduces common misrepresentations of statistical data. Some of the techniques are verbal while others are graphical. For example, drawing graphs in certain ways can help exaggerate or minimize certain types of data. Huff also when, why, and how to be cautious with certain types of statistics. He makes clear why organizations may want to misrepresent data (intentionally or accidentally) and when to identify these cases.</p>

    <p>For example he would explain how different methods of sampling might produce different outcomes. By altering sampling techniques, data can be completely skewed. Without proper information about sampling techniques, certain statistics can be completely unreliable. By presenting multiple scenarios with the same data set, he makes clear the dangers of naively trusting in statistics.</p>

    <p>Although most of the examples in the book are more than 50 years old (as the book was written quite a while ago), the examples are straightforward and occasionally come with accompanying illustrations of graphs and charts.</p>

    <p>Reading this book after <i>Cartoon Guide to Statistics</i> made me feel I had a deeper understanding of the topics that Huff mentions. Most concepts are introduced in a more quantitative manner in <i>Cartoon Guide to Statistics</i> but <i>How to Lie with Statistics</i> takes these topics and use them to your advantage. The book is a very quick read and written in a clear manner, easy to understand even without any background of statistics.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The book gives examples of how people and organizations present statistical data in a misleading way. The book goes through basics concepts of statistics and gives examples of how data can be represented and worded in various ways to convey completely different messages. Techniques range from visual representations of data (graphs, illustrations) to wording of data (mean, average, statistical “euphemism”). This book can be read to protect oneself against common tactics of statistical misrepresentations.</p>

        <h1>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics</h1>
        <h2>Larry Gonick & Woollcott Smith</h2>
        <h3>October 8, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I decided to read this book in attempt to gain a general understanding of the field of statistics. Prior to reading this book I had close to no understanding of statistics.</p>

    <p>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics attempts to take the reader through several fundamental concepts of statistics. It goes though fundamental topics such as normal distribution (a lot of normal distribution), confidence intervals, probability, sampling, standard deviation, p-values, t-distribution, hypothesis testing, and regression. These are all terms that I was unfamiliar prior to reading the book. I feel like I have a general understanding of these terms and what they represent. I do think that one of the main takeaways for me was the power of random selection and how proper sampling techniques can lead to normal distribution of data. The “comic” does a successful job of conveying the power and beauty of normal distribution.</p>

    <p>The book describes statistics from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint. Qualitatively, the viewer is described the importance of randomization, or different techniques for successful experimental design. These topics are much more accessible to the reader without a statistics education. On the other hand, most of the concepts are also described qualitatively through various equations. Some equations are rather trivial, and most are straightforward, but there are several examples where the derivation of equations is unclear. In addition, even if the equations and their meaning can be understood, I do not feel that I can apply these equations, or solve real statistics problems (nor do I think that the book is intended for that). With that said, I think the concise nature of the comic can serve as a good review for students with a proper statistics background.</p>

    <p>By going through topics quickly, I feel I was exposed to a wide range of topics quickly. I do feel a new appreciation for statistics after realizing its power and importance. Unfortunately most sections do lack depth and require additional sources to get a true understanding of them. For example, half a page is dedicated for box-and-whiskers plots. It explained the technicalities of them, but not enough information about the interpretations of different datasets represented as box-and-whiskers plots. The introduction to t-distributions was also too short to understand fully their significance. </p>

    <p>The illustrations are sometimes deceiving making certain topics seems much lighter than they are. In addition they add confusion, as the dialogue is irrelevant to the material so effort must be made to decipher its importance. The comics do keep the reading entertaining though (sometimes very smart jokes). Reading several chapters multiple times helped me understand the content much better. The comic-style of the book makes sometimes tempts you to rush through the pages but reading at a textbook pace is necessary for many of the more sophisticated sections.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A quick overview of the subject of statistics in comic format. The book gives several statistics concepts through straightforward examples. There are several quantitative explanations of the concepts through equations, which may serve as a simple reference guide for students for statistics.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts:</b> Expected values. Confidence intervals, Standard deviation, z-scores, t-distributions, hypothesis testing, Type-I/II error, p-values</p>

        <h1>Envisioning Information</h1>
        <h2>Edward R. Tufte</h2>
        <h3>October 4, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Envisioning Information is an inspirational book of how much love can be given to a seemingly dull subject. Tufte gives us ingenious examples of how multidimensional data has been represented on paper by different people in different subject areas throughout time. We see similar recurring strategies that are used for completely unrelated datasets. Tufte takes the reader on a journey, comparing and studying different data visualization strategies used.</p>

    <p>The best moments in the book are when Tufte gives bad examples of design, then presents us with a fixed version. He articulates the differences very clearly for the reader. Although the changes seem trivial and obvious (once presented with), the differences are stark. You can really tell the difference between work that someone “just doing their job” created opposed to an artful production of seemingly boring data. Tufte does this repeatedly with timetables for trains from all around the world and from centuries ago. These range from ingenious forms of timetable presentation invented by Charles Ybry to “ordinary” timetables in the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.</p>

    <p>This book also has a fair amount of examples from Japan. The book provides English translations but I also found it entertaining to be able to read and understand a lot of the original captions on the Japanese examples.</p>

    <p>Some things must be mentioned about the physical production of the book. The typesetting and design of this book is uncomfortably perfect. All of the diagrams, images, and examples are presented in the same page as the accompanying text. In typical books, descriptions and paragraphs overflow to the following page, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to compare the text and illustrations. Text is always contained within a single spread, perfectly compartmentalizing each spread by a separate topic (unless a topic spans multiple spreads). Margins on each page are cleverly used to accompany footnotes and images. The choice of materiality for the hardcover edition is also incredible. The heavy paper used in the book makes every page feel it is filled with importance. It is the kind of paper you want to flip carefully, as not to damage the pages. This makes the physical act of flipping each page a conscious one, requiring the reader to carefully delve deeper into the book. Envisioning Information itself is a masterpiece of presenting information.</p>

    <p>Galileo’s examples of discovering Jupiter’s moons, as well as graphical train timetables were my favorite part of the book. I would love to read his other books in the future as well.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Tufte gives us examples and strategies of converting multi-dimensional data into the world of the “flatland” (2D, paper). He gives us examples throughout history where artists, scientists, statisticians, have used various techniques to represent time, space, magnitude, and other qualitative factors on paper. The book makes clear what techniques work, and what doesn’t, and includes some psychological reasoning to back theories up. The book is dense with examples and references about data visualization throughout history and industries.</p>

    <p>Speculative Everything is not only about building imaginary products for future societies. Dunne and Raby broaden the scope of speculative design much further. Speculative works can encompass not only future worlds, but also parallel worlds and improbable futures. By not concentrating on profitability, designers can be more imaginative than ever. The value of a successful speculative design project should be measured by how thought provoking it is. Imagination into other possible societies, values, and ways of living, can also give us introspection into the society we live in right now.</p>

    <p>The book also goes into more practical advice for creating speculative works. It talks about how if a speculative work were too far fetched from our current world, it would be impossible for viewers to relate to it. On the other hand, if it a design were too familiar to what we would find commercially available, it wouldn’t courage viewers to enter an imaginative state. Striking a fine line between the real and the unreal is key to a successful speculative design project.<p>

    <p>By creating works that are thought provoking of possible futures, or alternative ways of living, there is a possibility that those speculations may influence how our future with shape. The book sees speculative design as a possible catalyst for social, economic, environmental, and aesthetic change. Much of today's commercial works are bound by realistic expectations and do not allow space for imagination. Speculative design is introduced as a tool to provoke thoughts, and completely reimagining how things are.</p>

    <p>The writing is unclear and hard to follow for someone new to the field of speculative design. Unlike Sapiens, which is written for anyone, speculative everything seems to be geared towards an audience already acquainted with the field and wants more references and inspiration. Many examples of works are mentioned throughout the book but often unaccompanied with any description. Even if they are accompanied with images, they usually only have a sentence or two to accompany them making if very difficult to understand what the project is about. Perhaps information is intentionally left out to make the reader “imagine” about what the work is about.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Speculative Everything introduces us to the field of speculative design. We are introduced to speculative works in other mediums such as literature, cinema, fashion, and painting. Through this, Dunne and Raby describe the uniqueness that the field of design could bring to speculative projects. The book is filled with many examples of speculative design (mostly from their students at Royal College of Art) and examples of speculative works from other mediums. The book articulates the value of speculative works, even if they are not produced as profitable items.</p>

    <p>This book gave me an opportunity to rethink what it means to be human. We have gotten so used to being “humans” that we sometimes forget that we are merely animals. Harari takes us through a journey from when Humans lived amongst other animals in the nature to our lives on modern day Earth. Reading about such past times makes you realize that so many of the rules, expectations, and mechanisms that dictate our lives today are creations of our imaginations (or myths as Harari would say).</p>

    <p>One of the main themes throughout the book is how our genetic structure has remained more of less the same since the first Homo Sapiens 150,000 years ago but how our society has evolved radically throughout history. Based on how humans use their collective imaginations, they have the power to completely change the way we live and function. The book takes a rather objective stance on various myths humans have believe with in the past. This made me think about the myths that we believe in today, and how these beliefs that make society function and not permanent nor absolute as much as they present themselves to be.<p>

    <p>One of my favorite takeaways in this book is the concept of inter-subjective truths. Unlike objective truths (eg. Gravity will attract object with a mass) and subjective truths (eg. Bob thinks that yesterday’s rain was caused by him stepping on an ant), inter-subjective truths are collective imaginations that exists in more than one body (eg. law, money, gods, nations) (ch. 6, Building Pyramids). Once you can identify something as an inter-subjective truth, it means that you can decide to believe in it or not with deliberation. This also gives you the ability to respect, empathize, and live amongst those who believe in different inter-subjective truths than yourself.</p>

    <p>It's an extremely fascinating book that's thought provoking in many ways. Great read, captivating from the first chapter.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Sapiens is a historical journey of the evolution of humans starting from when Homo Sapiens (“us”) used to live around other human speices such as Homo erectus and Homo soloensis. We are brought back to a world where we used to live amongst other animals. We follow the expansion of humans throughout the entire planet and see how we devised fictive creations to help keep order amongst our species. This book covers a wide range of topics, from religion, politics, ideologies, finance, biology, physics, law, and ethics.</p>
