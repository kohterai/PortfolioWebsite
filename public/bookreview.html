        <h1>Forbes Japan (No. 55 – February 2019)</h1>
        <h2>Forbes Japan</h2>
        <h3>January 4th, 2019</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This issue of Forbes Japan focused on designers who are bringing positive
    impact to their businesses through design. The magazine focused on
    international designers as well as Japanese designers. They each talk about
    their design philosophy in one way or another. Several of the Japanese
    designers have lengthy sections talking about how design affects Japanese
    society and businesses.</p>

    <p>There was one page about the patent office building a “design project
    management team”. It’s a bit unclear what they actually do but they talked
    about how their built a new team with over 50 members in it. It sounds
    incredibly innovative for a government entity. Shunsuke Ishikawa (BCG DV
    Tokyo) and Kenichi Nonomura (IDEO Tokyo) both talked about potential of
    design from a consultancy side, a lot of the international designers
    featured were designer- entrepreneur types like James Dyson (Dyson),
    Joe Gebbia/Brian Chesky (Airbnb), and Neil Blumenthal/Dave Gilboa (Warby
    Parker founders who seem to be highlighted awfully a lot lately).</p>

    <p>There was another article talking about Netflix’s expansion into Asia. I
    never really realized how recent of a company Netflix was, and how the
    founder’s background was in Computer Science. I also didn’t know that
    Airbnb’s “air” part came from “air bed”. I always though the “air” part
    had something to do with it being an internet service in the “cloud”.</p>

    <p>I did prefer the Forbes 30 under 30 issue, but I understand the format of
    the magazine better now so was able to read through it much quicker.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This edition of AXIS focused on the inhouse designers that major Japanese
    consumer product companies have. They got a selection of senior or head
    designers from major Japanese companies including Panasonic, Hitachi,
    Fujifilm, Canon, Nissan, Sony, and Mitsubishi Electric. It was quite
    entertaining to see how each company structured their design departments
    differently, and how each company has clear differences in their design
    philosophy and priorities.</p>

    <p>For example, Canon emphasizes ergonomics and usability. You can really
    feel that when you use their products. I noticed that one similarity
    between many of these companies is that they have recently created some
    sort of “innovation” branch in the organization, or the independence of
    the design team from the rest of the corporate structure. This is motivated
    by the urge for design teams to have space to operate more innovatively by
    distancing themselves from existing corporate structures.</p>

    <p>It is fun to read about companies that have successfully built an inhouse
    design culture and find ways to preserve it without making it too forceful.
    Each of the companies seemed to talk about what makes their design “theirs”
    without having strict design procedures that enforce consistency. I do feel
    that there is beauty in that, especially since it seems that a lot of the
    senior designers have spent decades in the design teams of their respective
    companies, so they have been trained by a particular design culture.</p>

    <p>At the end of the magazine there was a short motivational text by Gen
    Terao, the founder of Balmuda. Terao writes in his usual motivational tone,
    「鏡を見て、その人に納得がいかない場合は、どうすれば良いのか。答えは簡単だ。幸いなことに、
    私たちは鏡の中の人物の未来に、大きく関与できる能力を持っている。」(p.133) Great words
    to end the issue.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>First Forbes Japan magazine I read. The focus of the issue was “30 under 30”
    Japanese individuals. I found the magazine to be overall inspiring, to hear
    stories of so many entrepreneurs. I did find entrepreneurs that were tackling
    social problems to be very courageous. I can’t begin to imagine the struggles
    of starting a social startup. There was also a section about the finalists in
    the <i>EY World Entrepreneur of the Year</i>. Many businesses and entrepreneurs I’ve
    never heard of were highlighted.</p>

    <p>Noguchi Orono got the cover photo. I’ve never heard of her or her band before,
    but I watched some of her interviews online and she seems like someone living
    true to herself. I found it very inspiring. I’ve never really followed Tencent
    but an article about them made me realize how massive they are and how creative
    they are with their business. The article focused on how Tencent is building a
    market for writers and manga artists through their content platform. There were
    too many articles/advertisements for luxury watches and luxury cars for my taste.
    It’s very telling of the audience the magazine is targeted at.</p>

        <h1>The Republic</h1>
        <h2>Plato (Translated by Tom Griffith)</h2>
        <h3>December 6, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is the first philosophical text I’ve read. It was difficult at
      first to get used to the style of writing, especially since Plato makes
      lots of references to Greek mythology, as well as other philosophers of
      the time. The text is written in Socratic dialogue, where one of the
       characters (Socrates), asks questions to keep the conversation going forward.</p>

    <p>I picked up this book in hopes to get a better understanding of moral
      philosophy, hoping to learn what is “good” and what is “bad”.
      Instead what I got was a discourse that went a layer deeper,
      discussing whether it’s important to be just or if the illusion of
      being just is enough. Sometimes the dialog makes sudden pivots and
      the main point is discussed in convoluted ways that it makes me have to
      reread the text multiple times to understand what is being said.</p>

    <p>Then Plato goes on to discuss what a perfect city would look like,
      and different forms of governments that can exist. Great time is spent
      talking about what the ruler should be like, and what their education
      should be. I think Plato clearly takes an elitist, or classist stance on
      this. He does make a point that a ruler should rule for the best interest
       of the people, and not for his or her own benefits. This means the ruler
       should not be entitled to wealth.</p>

    <p>His way of imagining an ideal city ground up made me think about
      certain norms and beliefs that are set in brick today. For example,
      Plato goes a great deal to moderate the types of Heroes that are
      idolized in his city. What kinds of people are considered Heroes today?
       Of course, this depends by culture but it’s possible that these are
        thoughts and expectations that are embedded in us by certain rulers,
         intentionally or unintentionally.</p>

    <p>I find it fun to think how humans over 2000 years ago were able to
       think so sophisticatedly. It reminds me of Homo Deus and how Harari
       starts his book off explaining to us how humans have biologically not
        “upgraded” since Homo Sapiens emerged (us). To read such an ancient
        text with so much thought is evidence for that.</p>

    <p>Plato did feel a bit narcissistic at parts, especially when
      preaching the importance of philosophers in society. Also, parts of
      the Socratic dialogue where Socrates would say something in a convoluted
       way and the listener would respond “I don’t understand, can you simplify”,
        and Socrates would say something along the lines of “It’s already so
        simplified, I can’t believe you don’t understand”. This sort of back
        and forth felt like a simple ego boost for himself.</p>

    <p>Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and gave me a lot of new thoughts
      about how our society is constructed, and how so many forms of governance
      can exist. Plato also does talk about gender equality and communal
      parenting, which feels like rather “innovative” social thinking,
      at least in today’s society. Griffith made the translation with
      an emphasis to make the text feel like a conversation as much as
       possible. I found the translation to be pretty straightforward
       and easy to read. With that said, if I were to read another
       philosophical text, I would love to try a more recent philosopher.</p>

        <h1>Bullshit Jobs</h1>
        <h2>David Graeber</h2>
        <h3>November 11, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Bullshit Jobs is a recent book (2018) written by a professor at the London School of Economics. Graeber describes a phenomenon that he describes called “bullshit jobs” which he feels that no one is talking about but is a modern day epidemic.</p>

    <p>First, he begins by describing what he considers at a bullshit job and describes the kinds of bullshit jobs that exist in the market. Then he discusses how the people doing these bullshit jobs feel about them, and why they continue doing them. Since Graeber has a background in Anthropology, he brings out the anthropological side out to theorize why bullshit jobs has proliferated in developed countries, and finally what we can do about that.</p>

    <p>I picked this book up since it was available at a bookstore in London and since I was in the midst of thinking about what it means to work and what jobs are, that it would be an interesting read. Graeber bases most of his theories off of comments and stories he received from various people who feel that they have bullshit jobs.</p>

    <p>First and foremost, Graeber says that in order for a job to be a bullshit job, the employee themselves must think that it’s a bullshit job. If they feel that it’s a bullshit job, at that point it is humiliating to keep working in such a job, but the argument goes that the way our capitalistic society is structured, prevents these people from picking up another job while maintaining a decent standard of living. This is the premise of the book.</p>

    <p>I must say that this is an incredibly sensationalist piece of writing, but I think he does present points that many people can empathize with, and even if the problem is not as wide spread as the author believes, I do believe that these types of “bullshit jobs” do exist out there, and that it is not productive.</p>

    <p>If a person believes that their job is bullshit, I do feel that it is their responsibility to do something about it. But with that said, if the whole system is ambivalent to this type of problem to the extend the author describes, then I do feel bad for those stuck in these jobs. I’m also curious why the author is so emotionally invested in this matter. Does he feel like he has a bullshit job himself? Or does he feel that he is a victim of people working on these bullshit jobs? It’s unclear.</p>

    <p>Personally, this book was food for thought to think about why people work. People work for many different reasons. Work could be for money. But work could also be to gain societal respect and status. Or work could be a place for one’s sense of belonging. But I do agree that work for the sake of work can be problematic. Perhaps another angle to the problem he describes is to think about why people feel that their work is bullshit. Maybe there has always been bullshit jobs. Maybe people just feel that they are meant to be doing “more” or have a greater sense of purpose. Maybe it’s social media that is making people feel that they are not living the lives they want to live. Maybe it’s not work itself that is the problem but the people. I say this because many forms of work can be classified as “bullshit” if you ask enough “why” questions.</p>

    <p>Graeber is brave to write a book about this. At the end he does bring up the idea of universal basic income. Although he does state that he doesn’t want this book to be categorized as a “universal basic income” book, the phenomena and the ideas he discusses are clearly relevant if someday we do shift to a lifestyle of UBI. Because the culture of work is so deeply engrained in society and culture, that if we were to admit that most work is unnecessary, or just a product of bureaucracy, or isn’t really productive for society, then we really do need to rethink our values and our purpose of living. Graeber does make us think about the value of work through his book. I do think the book is too extreme and makes a lot of strong statements that are quite questionable though.</p>

        <h1>ビジネスモデル2.0図鑑</h1>
        <h2>Tetsuro Kondoh</h2>
        <h3>November 8, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I decided to read this book based on a recommendation from a friend at my co-working space. The entirety of this book is available online for free, but I decided to buy a physical copy nevertheless.</p>

    <p>This book shows “diagrams” of a hundred different businesses. Kondoh categorizes the businesses into the 4 categories of things, finance, information, and people. Some of the business models are startups, while others are new services that established companies have started, and others are business models of established companies that the author felt that most people don’t know about.</p>

    <p>The concept of the book is interesting — to create an encyclopedia of interesting business models. But I felt that a lot of the book felt forced, and that a lot of the content was not researched deeply. I can see that a lot of effort was put into making the information look interesting (nice looking diagrams, etc.). But most of the description felt like information that a 5 minute Google search could reveal. In fact, I felt that the “business model diagrams” were unnecessary for most of the businesses. Each business was given 1 page for the business model diagram, and 1 page for a description of the business. The description pages were far more descriptive than the diagrams for many of the examples. Although the information itself may not have depth, I do think that the book provides a lot of breadth into a wide range of industries and niche products and services that I never knew existed. The author also tries to present an international set of companies, so a handful are Japanese, but many are from abroad.</p>

    <p>Kondoh only chose businesses that he felt had the three qualities of being socially productive, creative, and able to operate financially. Since he didn’t just focus on a business’ ability to produce financial outcomes, the collection of companies do feel unique.</p>

    <p>Overall it did not feel like a satisfying read. I would have preferred 15~20 of the business models that the author felt were the most interesting and to go into depth regarding why the business models are interesting. I also kept feeling that this book’s primary purpose is to sell the author’s businesses’ service, which is creating these business model diagrams.</p>

    <p>Three businesses I found amusing were <i>Fundbox</i> which helps SMBs speed up cash flow through factoring, <i>WeLive</i> by <i>WeWork</i> which provides a living community with a community manager (like college dorms with an RA(?)), and <i>ZOZOSUIT</i> (which I heard about but never knew what it was about).</p>

        <h1>行こう、どこにもなかった方法で</h1>
        <h2>Gen Terao</h2>
        <h3>October 19, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is an autobiography written by the founder of Balmuda. The first time I read about him was in the AXIS design magazine. I found this book while walking around the book store and decided that it would be an interesting book to read.</p>

    <p>This book is poetic and full of emotion. I haven’t read a book that made me feel so emotional in a while. Maybe it’s because I can empathize with some of the things he says, or maybe it’s because he’s so honest and vulnerable about who he was and who he is. The book feels incredibly personal but gives you an honest peak into someone’s life very different from mine. It also shows how much work it took him to get to where he is right now, but he really conveys the importance of dedication and obsessiveness required to help shape his life to where he wanted it to be. It also shows how big of an influence parenting and one’s environment can have on someone.</p>

    <p>He mentioned was how when he made the switch from being a musician to a designer, his tools changes but the drive and intentions behind his actions remained the same. 「音楽時代の私と、あの頃の私は、持っているものも、心意気も変わっていなかった。ただ、ギターやマイクといった道具を、ドライバーや工作機械に持ち替えただけだった」(p.169) I think this is beautiful and important, since when it comes to occupation, so much emphasis is put on what we do, rather than how we approach what we do. More and more I feel that the medium of my output is less and less important, and what I need to take care of is my drive rather than my output.</p>

    <p>I see a handful of similarities between James Dyson and Gen Terao. They both had an incredible about of obsessiveness and passion to bring something new and beautiful to this world. (They also did create products that relate to wind). Both of them are incredible design engineers, although I would say that Terao seems far more artistic and romantic rather than Dyson. Most importantly they both had the conviction to go through the immense struggles to bring to life their creations. They took full responsibility and ownership of their product. With that said Terao’s writing feels far more refined and humbling than Dyson’s.</p>

    <p>It’s the first biography I read of a Japanese entrepreneur. It’s incredibly inspiring.</p>

        <h1>On the Map: Why the World Looks the Way it Does</h1>
        <h2>Simon Garfield</h2>
        <h3>October 10, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>When I was at the bookstore, I decided that I would try picking up a book from a genre I usually don’t read (this eliminates tech, popular science, self-help, and design books). When I skimmed the book at the bookstore, it had many old looking maps, and appeared to be a history of cartography. I’ve always thought cartography is an interesting profession, a great mix of technical skills and the arts (just like cinematographer). In fact, I’ve had thoughts in the past that I would have loved to pursue the profession of a cartographer if I was born several centuries ago. Anyway, I decided that this book would be a change from my usual reading list.</p>

    <p>I think a more appropriate title for the book would be “Short Stories Involving Maps”. I thought it would be a more comprehensive historical account of mapmaking, but it’s actually little snippets and stories that involve various maps. For example, the story behind the sale of the Mappa Mundi and its significance, to seeing the world from the earliest accounts of the world of Eratosthenes and Ptolemy. Towards the end of the book, the stories become more meta-cartography like cartography in video games or mapping of the brain.</p>

    <p>As a person with no prior knowledge of cartography, it was quite a fun read, although I did not enjoy the meta-cartography stories towards the end. The book started to feel quite long and I had to skim through the last chapters, since they didn’t feel as exciting (e.g. London Subway Map, Maps in Video Maps, GPS systems) With that said, I did find the stories from the earliest days of cartography quite exciting. For example, to imagine these cartographers sailing into literally unknown, sounds like quite an adventure. We take it for granted now that we know what the world looks like, but to imagine there was a time that this was not the case, is fascinating. Perhaps it’s similar to the way we think of the universe right now.</p>

    <p>Some of the stories involve cartographers creating fictitious landmarks on maps, that end up being duplicated for centuries. For example, a fictitious mountain called the Mountains of Kong that were created in Africa or California being represented as an island. We take accurate maps for granted, and don’t even consider it a possibility that what we see on Google Maps may be inaccurate (or at least I don’t). So, in many ways, having charted most of the world takes away the romance of having so many “unknowns” about our world. This is true in many levels (not just in physical maps of the world).</p>

    <p>One of the chapters was about John Snow and the Cholera map. Of course, I’m familiar with this from Tufte’s books but it did feel good to have some overlap there. My biggest criticism, which I started feeling after being halfway done with the book is that a lot of the stories are heavily centered around cartography stories in England. Of course, there are a few stories that involve the US but it would be difficult to say that it represents a global history of mapmaking. Also, I wish the book came with more pictures of the maps that it talks about (and in greater detail). It’s tricky to imagine the maps without actually seeing them.

    <p>The chapters are short and self-contained, so I do think it’s a good book for bedtime reading.</p>

        <h1>Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs</h1>
        <h2>Ken Kocienda</h2>
        <h3>September 19, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Ken is the engineer and designer behind iOS’s first keyboard. We take it for granted now but he shares with us the journey and thought process behind how the keyboard came to be. The book’s title includes Apple and Steve Jobs, but these two things were secondary to me while reading. I was interested in the thinking and collaboration that Kocienda experienced during his time at Apple.</p>

    <p>Firstly, Kocienda was an Engineer. But, the way he thinks and creates, makes him a designer. He is a great example of a design engineer. In Stanford’s Design Impact Program, one of their answer’s to their FAQs say ""That said, you do not need anyone’s permission to be a designer. Design can be a philosophy, a viewpoint, or a unique way of framing and tackling a problem. The best candidates cannot help themselves; they are always trying to improve and change the world around them. If you want to change something, you have to design”. I felt like Kocienda really embodies this spirit of design. In fact reading this books makes you feel like everyone at Apple embodies this sort of thinking.</p>

    <p>The second thing that came to mind was how small the initial iOS and Safari teams were. In a huge company like Apple I imagined that there were huge teams behind new product launches. But instead, Kocienda describes almost a start-up like atmosphere, with the best talent from the company put together to bootstrap new products. This was surprising to me, but sounds incredibly exciting (if you are inside one of these special teams). So clearly there is a lot politics that go inside who gets to work on these groundbreaking projects and who doesn’t.</p>

    <p>The book really makes you appreciate the importance of prototyping and designing in a development process. Also what amazed me was how Kocienda describes how even the leadership behind the new product needs to get their hands dirty and help out with the grunt work. In other words, they couldn’t just outsource the grunt work to interns or an R&D team. The people responsible for the project would take it from start to finish. This makes the development team more invested in the project, and gives them a more fundamental understanding and appreciation of what is being created.</p>

    <p>This book is quite nerdy at times, but it is quite a gem. It’s not a famous design book but it brings a very practical design case to discussion, unlike many design books, which are more theoretical and less practical. Also reading this book makes you interact with your iPhone keyboard with a much deeper level of appreciation. It works so well that the right solution seems obvious but reading Kocienda’s book makes you realize that there was a time that these solutions were not obvious, and there were people that worked hard to find these solutions.</p>

        <h1>Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams</h1>
        <h2>Matthew Walker</h2>
        <h3>September 3, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I've developed many personal theories about sleep during my High School years. I've had times when I've been frustrated by the fact that I need to sleep everyday. During my college years I've realized that the amount of sleep I get affects my mood and performance the next day. This book had demystified everything I've ever wondered about the purpose and meaning of sleep.</p>

    <p>My biggest takeaway is that having quality sleep everyday is incredibly important for humans. It is so important to us for our physical and mental health. The book makes many references to experiments that have been conducted and other humans and animals that intentionally disrupt sleep (in many different ways). The outcomes are always clear that disrupting sleep causes negative outcomes. Walker says, "Rats will die after fifteen days without sleep, on average". That's quite crazy when we think about how lack of sleep can kill an animal.</p>

    <p>Walker also focuses a lot of the discourse on how we as a society have been neglecting sleep so much. We fail to acknowledge the importance of it, and also fail to educate ourselves about it despite the fact that we spend a good 1/3 of our lives sleeping.</p>

    <p>His last chapter about "A New Vision for Sleep in the Twenty-First Century" was my favorite. He comes up with many ideas of how technology and "smart homes" can enhance people's quality of sleep. Walker also foresees a future where cars can come with internal facing trackers that can detect drowsy sleeping. He has a lot of practical ideas that can help society value sleep more, and realistic ways of how technology can better people's quality of sleep.</p>

    <p>I love lighting, and the idea of lighting inside homes that change throughout the night and morning to help people sleep and wake up is fun just to think about. Walker talks about how NASA has already spent lot of money researching lighting that helps Astronauts get proper sleep up in space (since the satellites orbit Earth so quick, their bodies cannot experience normal 24 hour days). This is a startup idea that I would be interested in exploring.</p>

    <p>There seems to be a lot more interest in people tracking their sleep patterns on their phones lately. It seems like we are becoming more aware of how important sleep is to us, and making efforts to treating our sleep with respect.</p>

    <p>My only criticism for this book is that a lot of it is much more technical and scientific than I prefer (lots of words for parts of the brain, lots of words for different types of chemicals -- it makes me sleep reading) as well as Walker coming off as peachy at times, making sleep sound like the most important thing to humans (I am convinced it is important but there are other important things to our well being as well). But overall it felt like an important read for my wellbeing, and would recommend others to read it as well.</p>

        <h3>August 11, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This books is separated into several categories of How People See, How People Read, How People Remember, How People Think, How People Focus Their Attention, What Motivates People, People Are Social Animals, How People Feel, People Make Mistakes, and How People Decide.</p>

    <p>A lot of the concepts were basic to me but my favorite chapter was What Motivated People. Often UX designers focus on usability but not really on what motivates users to keep using a product or keep trying different features.</p>

    <p>The book is a quick and light read. It makes many references to studies and researchers, which were not useful to me but can be useful for people who are into UX research or want to read original sources of the research.</p>

    <p>This book makes it clear how an understanding of psychology is valuable to producing great design. For example applying scientific research highlighted in the How People See section can help create great visual design that can be justified by psychology research.</p>

    <p>The book does not feel profound but can be a good quick read for people who are not acquainted with this kind of thinking. But it's not written in an inspiring way like Design of Everyday Things. It feels much more like a textbook.</p>

        <h1>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character</h1>
        <h2>Richard P. Feynman</h2>
        <h3>August 3, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This book filled with anecdotes and thoughts that Richard Feynman had throughout his life. They range from his early childhood days, to being in college, early career as a physicist, and after he began becoming a well respected figure in the field.</p>

    <p>Feynman is a quirky, funny guy. He constantly tries to outwit people and is quite clear that he tries to have fun with his life. His writing inspires us to think for ourselves, and not be scared of outwitting people. He is sort of a stubborn guy in some respects, and I can really empathize with a lot of the stories in which he is frustrated and tries to play “games” against bureaucracy. I understand that, and sometimes I act this way myself.</p>

    <p>His stories are fun because he makes clear what he likes and doesn’t like, and is not scared to admit that or to do the things he likes. For example, he is not shy about playing the drums. Or trying out art. Or flirting with girls (he talks a lot about flirting with girls). He loves physics. He hates bureaucracy. He is very vocal about his criticisms.</p>

    <p>You can really sense his energy just by reading his book. He seems like the kind of guy who I would enjoy being friends with. He also clearly doesn’t take himself too seriously, which is really fun to read from a Nobel Prize winner. But he barely talks about the Novel Prize, and rarely delves deep into physics. But you can tell that he is a smart man. It’s also fun to read about his life and his experiences before he became such a well-known person (although he seems to have left an impression with all the people he met throughout his life).</p>

    <p>It's an entertaining read and an inspiring example of living life fully.</p>

        <h1>Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</h1>
        <h2>Phil Knight</h2>
        <h3>July 24, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I loved reading this book. It was a very entertaining book to read, so entertaining that I finished it in one day. Phil Knight writes in such a honest, genuine manner. He’s honest about his flaws, and his snobbishness. What makes this writing great is how he talks about the events in his life with such great attention. For example, Phil’s thoughts and emotions of his important meetings are written in such great detail and honesty. So its quite exhilarating to read. For example, he talks about how he felt prior to the meeting, during the meeting, after the meeting, but also reflects on his actions from his present point of view. I don’t know how he recalls these events with such great detail, so much detail in-fact, that it feels like a work of fiction.</p>

    <p>I’ve personally never heard of Phil Knight, knew nothing about his history, or what he looks like, so I read the book like a work of fiction, whilst knowing that it is all real. It’s very exciting.</p>

    <p>A lot of the excitement for me was also reading about his experiences in Japan, post-war. His descriptions of Japan are from decades before I knew of Japan, and describe the country I was born and live in, in a fashion that I am completely unfamiliar with. The Japan he describes is not the Japan I know. And he describes it from the perspective of an outsider. It felt like I was reading a history book.</p>

    <p>I can respect the way he lives his life, and the choices he made. It’s very exciting and something to learn from. Aside from learning about all the cash flow problems that early Nike had, it was respectable to hear that he kept working his job as an accountant for many years during the early years of his business. He really hedged his risks well. But he also describes it as a necessity, that his business did not produce enough revenue to pay him.</p>

    <p>I didn’t think much of Nike, or knew much about them but learning so much about the early days of the business was so exhilarating. So much fun. Highly recommend read, to learn about a way of living an exhilarating life, and the struggles of starting a business.</p>

        <h1>Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think</h1>
        <h2>Hans Rosling</h2>
        <h3>July 10, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Factfulness</i> attempts to educate us about the state of present state of the world. The book is written under the premise that many of us misinterpret how “bad” the world is, without understanding actual data, and oversee how much improvement has taken place over the years.</p>

    <p>My biggest takeaway from the book was the data visualizations. Many of them are clever and get the message across very clearly. In fact the visualizations are so straightforward that you can probably understand 90% of the book just by studying the visualizations without reading a word of the text. As someone who enjoyed reading Tufte, this is a great example of how effective good graphs and charts can be.</p>

    <p>I think the Dollar Street project is an incredible idea and incredibly to the point. The project photographs people’s homes from various income levels and uses the photographs to compare their standards of living.</p>

    <p>The personal stories and anecdotes told by Rosling and his experiences are a medical professional add credibility to the content he delivers.</p>

    <p>I feel lucky to have travelled to countries in all “4 levels” so can understand to some extent to gaps he describes. But Rosling far spent far more time, and with far greater intimacy that he does bring a far deeper level of understanding of differences in quality of live amongst different income levels. To people that have not had the privilege to travel to countries of other income levels, this book may be quite eye opening.</p>

    <p>One of my thoughts is that you can travel to a country that is listed in different levels, but still experience a lifestyle similar to where you come from. For example, someone that ordinarily lives in level 4, the highest income level can travel to a level 2 country, but stay in a luxury resort and live the lifestyle of level 4. This is obvious but dangerous for people that may naively think that they “understand” without actually understanding. The author does touch upon this but this can also be true inside of a country. You can live in a level 3 country but live the lifestyle of level 4, or vice versa. This is one of the reasons I think that the Dollar Street project is powerful.</p>

    <p>Also fun to note that the color of the cover is the same as <i>Utopia for Realists</i>.</p>

    <p>I never heard about Bridgewater or Ray Dalio before reading this book.</p>

    <p>It's interesting to hear about a company culture that is based off of radical transparency (as described in his book). But I found most of the principles quite obvious, and not very profound (perhaps the obviousness proves they are effective principles).</p>

    <p>His "work principles" were the most valuable part of his book. Dalio does have lots of years as a business owner, so he does present effective ways of looking at, and managing people.</p>

    <p>It's a quick read and shows a unique way for an organization to be built, but none of the content is profound nor thought provoking. I don't have much that stuck with me after reading the book.</p>

        <h1>12 Rules for Life - An Antidote to Chaos</h1>
        <h2>Jordan B. Peterson</h2>
        <h3>June 28, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I feel much calmer and wiser after reading <i>12 Rules for Life</i>. Peterson uses his years as a Psychologist discuss human imperfections honestly. It helped me with some introspection regarding my being.</p>

    <p>My biggest criticism of the book is that Peterson often digresses into religious and mythological references (about half of the book). When this digression first happened, it made me extremely confused and made the book difficult to read. Towards the end of the book, I started appreciating and understanding his digressions, but overall, I found them distracting me from his main principles.</p>

    <p>Some chapters discuss people with serious psychological problems (mass murderers who resent the world, tyrants, etc.) and made me realized that despite the suffering I may sometimes feel in my life, my circumstances are nowhere near as bad as they can be.</p>

    <p>The subtitle to the book is "An Antidote to Chaos" and I feel that this exactly what the book achieves (despite the chapters often being convoluted). For example, in Rule 4 "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today", he writes "We might start considering the all-too-black-and-white words themselves: "success" or "failure." You are either a success, a comprehensive, singular, over-all good thing, or its opposite, a failure, a comprehensive, singular, irredeemably bad thing. The words imply no alternative and no middle ground. However, in a world as complex as ours, such generalizations are a sign of naive, unsophisticated or even malevolent analysis" (p. 88) I personally do have a bad tendency of viewing the world in black and white. But direct statements like these, make me question my ways of thinking and calms me down with any stress that my (harmful) ways of thinking may cause.</p>

    <p>One of my key takeaways from this book is the importance of being truthful to yourself, and to others. Dishonestly causes an array of problems, and the quicker you can be honest about something, the easier it is to deal with (even though it may cause momentary discomfort). My letting out your thoughts into the world, you can see how others react to it, and change (or not change) based on the feedback from the world (and can iterate based on those responses).</p>

    <p>"Do not let your children do anything that makes your dislike them" (Rule 5) is a chapter about parenting. I've never read any literature on parenting, so this was a new and unexpected subject to me. I believe the premise is that it's important to scold (and reward) children so that they grow up to be societally acceptable humans. I would naively think that it's better to just let children do what they like, and that its not good to criticize them because it would hurt their feelings. But children do not know anything about the world, and an adult must teach them what is acceptable, and what is not. I find that in a lot of my relationships I tend to take a non-confrontational, nonaggressive approach where I never get upset. What first starts off as tolerance and being sweet eventually leads to resentment (which is no good for either party).</p>

    <p>Compared to self-help books I've read in the past, this one feels far more realistic about the human condition and writes in a colder tone (perhaps may even sound cynical). It was a worthy read.</p>

        <h1>Utopia for Realists</h1>
        <h2>Rutger Bregman</h2>
        <h3>June 21, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I read this book without knowing that it is about Universal Basic Income (UBI). I've always been interested in UBI as a concept, so it was great to get to read more about it. Overall this book felt quite preachy like a big rant.</p>

    <p>The chapter that I enjoyed the most is when he talks about "bullshit jobs". He makes a bold point that many jobs today are unnecessary, and the people doing the jobs also feel that their jobs are unnecessary. (Chapter 7, Why It Doesn't Pay to Be a Banker). I personally haven't experiences working in these kinds of jobs, so I can't make an accurate judgement, but I wouldn't be surprised if these jobs are indeed pointless.</p>

    <p>Bregman also breaks down and attempts to destigmatize the idea of giving away "free money". He brings up countless experiments that show that when people are given money for free, they tend to use it responsibly and to the extent that they start using the money they had from before more responsibly as well. While the common assumption to the idea of giving away free money is that it will make people lazy or that the money will be used recklessly, Bregman's data shows otherwise.</p>

    <p>It also seems that we are also conditioned that receiving "free money" as something to feel guilty about. It someone gives us $100 for "free" we would feel not ok about it. Instead, if we spend 10 hours doing "bullshit" and get paid $100, it's okay because we "earned it". I agree that our human society has made such immense progress that there should be a sort of "dividend" that we can all get out of. Bregman argues that these dividends should come in monetary form. But perhaps, we already do receive dividends of our ancestor's efforts through non-monetary forms, such as more global peace, better health, better technology, etc</p>

    <p>I do believe that Universal Basic Income, even at a very basic level is a goal worthy of working towards as a society. By guaranteeing a certain level of sustenance, it should help people to be more careful about the way they want to use their time, and not take "bullshit" jobs out of desperation.</p>

    <p>Also, Bregman tells the story of New York City Sanitation Workers going on a strike, and the whole city suffering the consequences. He contrasts this with a group of bankers going on a strike, but no one suffering any real consequences. It does amuse me that the more "bullshit" jobs also tend to get paid much higher than work that provides more tangible, and obvious output.</p>

    <p>The overall tone of the book is quite rant-like so it takes away from his credibility.</p>

        <h1>TIME - The Science of Happiness</h1>
        <h2>TIME Magazine</h2>
        <h3>June 18, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This TIME issue focuses only on Happiness. Each article focuses on different aspects of happiness. There the three sections of mind, life, and spirit. Some of the themes tackled are spirituality, money, and marriage/children.</p>

    <p>A lot of the articles bring up mindfulness and meditation as an effective tool for achieving happiness. Some of the articles seem subjective, but most articles bring up various studies and statistics to back their claims up.</p>

    <p>A couple of key points I want to note down: Continuing to work stressfully and delaying happiness can be never ending. Focusing on one thing and being present, will bring lots of happiness. Schedule some time for yourself. You can train resilience. Thoughts you have again and again trains neuronal highway, turning them into defaults. You have control for 40% of your happiness (50% genetic, 10% circumstance), although I think these percentages feel off that's what TIME says. Social relationships are very important. Plan weekends ahead so that you don't fill them in with "meh" last minute plans, and you can also have something to look forward to. A great marriage can really add to happiness, although lots of time and energy needs to be invested. Children don't add happiness or take away? You easily adjust to things, so more money not necessarily makes you happier (hedonic treadmill). People tend to compare themselves to "similar others". Having close friends and investing and close relationships are important. If you can turn everything into an experience, you can be very happy. Mindfulness and meditation really helps. A big reason religious affiliation makes people happier is because it gives a sense of meaning and purpose and also brings you together with a large community. Belonging in the Majority makes people happy and being in a minority can be stressful. Being grateful and expressing gratitude can make you happier.</p>

    <p>I want to invest more in making close friends and also finding myself a community. It was also great to read that strong marriages really make people happy.</p>

        <h1>TIME - The Drone Age</h1>
        <h2>TIME Magazine</h2>
        <h3>June 15, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This issue of TIME Magazine has a special report on Drones. It has a dedicated article on various uses of drones from military use, art, delivery, and photography/film.</p>

    <p>Firstly, Zipline was also highlighted in TIME so they must be getting a lot of attention as a drone startup. The article was mainly similar to that of the MIT Tech Review but with different photographs.</p>

    <p>The most interesting article for me was that of military use. I knew that drones have been used in the military, but there is a rising concern for consumer grade drones to be modified and weaponized. Without the drones having IDs it is impossible to figure out who is flying and owns a drone. In addition, I can see how a swarm of micro drones, if targeted towards an individual, can be very difficult to shoot down (they are very small and move very fast). This is like the bee episode from Black Mirror.</p>

    <p>The photographs in the report were intriguing, especially a photo from Johannesburg, South Africa, highlighting the inequality between two sides of the road. I felt that such a start contrast in inequality can only be shown from above. The cover photo is also great.</p>

        <h1>MIT Technology Review - Best in Tech 2018</h1>
        <h2>MIT Technology Review</h2>
        <h3>June 13, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This issue of MIT Technology Review focuses on cutting edge technology. Most technologies are still being worked on but give us a glimpse of what our future may look like. Each article focuses either on a startup, or a technology, where its current progress is at, and what this means for our future.</p>

    <p>The topics covered are automation, geoengineering, generative adversarial networks, smart cities, DNA sequencing, drones, artificial gametes, crypto mining, neural nets, conversational AIs, clean energy startups, gentrification, and bioengineering for crops.</p>

    <p>Reading these articles amazed to know that there are people working on things that sound like they are from the future. With that said, many of these cutting-edge technologies will have major social impacts. For example, crypto mining brings up ethical questions such as whether we should be "wasting" electricity on all the mining. Genetic sequencing of reproductive cells could bring clear advantages to richer people than those who cannot afford it.</p>

    <p>One of the concepts that I never came by before was Geoengineering. It does seem like a creative solution to our problems with climate change, one that I've never heard being talked about before. With that said, it makes me concerned that this make people more reckless, just by knowing that there are possible safety nets that may excuse us from changing our current ways of living.</p>

    <p>The magazine focused on a drone startup called Zipline which delivers blood and medical supplies in Rwanda. I can see how given its terrain and compact size Rwanda is a great place to develop such a service. Out of all the articles, drone startups do seem to be the closest technology that may impact our everyday lives. The drones that Zipline developed can fly in almost any weather and can service half the country from a single launching site. Instead of the quadcopters, they look like miniature airplanes. The startup makes a lot of sense for a country with a lot of forest and where road conditions may not be excellent throughout the country. It is questionable though whether it makes sense for investments to go to the startup before they go to improving their infrastructure (roads). This approach of skipping a paradigm, seems similar to an article about solar energy startups in Africa I read in the New Yorker. Instead of taking some African countries through the development of electric grids, the startups are focusing on distributing solar panels to each family or group of families so that they can generate their own electricity. I do find tech startups in Africa definitely interesting, and by no means countries should be required to follow the same technological progress that the Western countries followed.</p>

    <p>Another article that I found interesting was about how some cryptominers are trying to be environmentally conscientious by using renewable energy sources for their mining (hydroelectricity in the article). Profitability aside, I find it an interesting bizarre to imagine facilities full of mining computers (machines) that are doing useless brute force hashing puzzles all day, consuming natural resources, creating a new form of currency. Yes, maybe it makes sense from a profitability standpoint, but the things humans would do for money are quite bizarre. With that said, if real investments are going into producing and maintaining crypto (human's time and energy + money), I do feel that the miners will go out of their way to maintain its value, and that it is unlikely for the currencies to completely lose its value.</p>

    <p>One my biggest take away is the intricate relationship between policy makers and new technologies. New Technology forces policies to adapt, while old policies may limit the development of new technology. Our ethical norms must also be able to adapt accordingly.</p>

    <p>The magazine makes me want to contribute and be at the forefront of progress of our human civilization.</p>

        <h1>Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It</h1>
        <h2>Chris Voss with Tahl Raz</h2>
        <h3>June 8, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Never Split the Difference is a book about negotiations written by a former FBI hostage negotiator. Chris Voss has a tremendous amount of experience rescuing people out of life-or-death hostage situations and shares us his negotiation techniques he has accumulated over the years. The idea is that these techniques can be used in any negotiation setting from hostage situations to negotiating a raise in salary.</p>

    <p>This book's premise is that negotiation is a highly emotional matter and should not be approached with only logical reasoning since humans are highly emotional creatures. This theme of human emotions reminded me of the discussions in <i>Homo Deus</i> and also in <i>AlphaGo</i>. Humans are highly susceptible to changes in emotions. We see this in <i>AlphaGo</i> when Lee Sedol feels immense pressure while challenging against AlphaGo, which clearly has impact on his performance whilst AlphaGo continues its calculation, unaffected by all this emotion. In many ways Never Split the Difference is about understanding how human emotions behave and being able to work it to your advantage.</p>

    <p>It must be said that this book is not really a cookbook for great negotiations. A lot of effective techniques are brought up, but I can tell that in order to effectively use them during a negotiation, I would need to practice the techniques quite a bit. With that said, the book does provide a framework in which negotiation should be looked at, providing me with the right kind of attitude to approach a negotiation (very much like how <i>Intelligent Investor</i> teaches you the right mindset for investments, but reading the book in itself does not make you a good investor).</p>

    <p>A lot of emphasis is put into how to effectively guide the other person's desires to meet yours, but I think the most difficult part of any emotionally tense situation (like a negotiation) is how to keep your own emotions under control. This is still a huge mystery to me.</p>

    <p>Parts of this book also does feel like an advertisement for Chris Voss' services and him explaining to us how great he is. I also felt like some of the examples given for successful negotiations are outright fraudulent which makes me uncomfortable. For example, when you only need $600, you act as if $650 is the lowest you can go. The book claims that successful negotiations actually leave both sides in a better emotional state, regardless of the quantitative value of the result. For example, if I let someone haggle from $900 to $720 to $610 to $565 and I pretend like I cannot go any lower (Ackerman Model), it will leave the other party more satisfied than if I honestly gave them my absolutely lowest number of $500 from the beginning. This kind of behavior seems manipulative and dishonest. Of course, you feel the other side with a great sense of accomplishment and bargain, but you outright lied to them. How can lying be an effective method for building empathy for future deals?</p>

    <p>A good part of the book is that it acknowledges that negotiation is not comfortable, but that its natural and okay that way. It's a quick read and as someone who has never read a book on negotiation before, it's made me realize that negotiation is really something that I need to practice, and that there is a lot that I need to learn to become truly effective at it.</p>

    <p>On a side note, if there comes a day we must negotiate with machines it must be incredibly difficult without any emotional exchanges involved (or at least it would be one way). Human emotions would need to be quantified by the machine so that it knows exactly where your breaking point is. Perhaps human can drug themselves to deceive the machine that it is more stubborn than it actually is, or to reduce overall emotions so that the human can also become machine-like themselves.</p>

        <h1>Homo Deus - A Brief History of Tomorrow</h1>
        <h2>Yuval Noah Harari</h2>
        <h3>June 5, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Homo Deus is Harari's sequel to Sapiens.</p>

    <p>The book is thought provoking. Many questions are brought up but does not dig deep enough for the reader to be able to create conclusive thoughts or opinions. Each of the numerous topics that are brought up could easily be turned into a book of its own.</p>

    <p>For example, some of the topics brought up are animal rights, environmental damage, and future of employment. Harari brings up these topics in a provocative manner but at best it expands your imagination to think about what the future of humanity looks like.</p>

    <p>I think the uniqueness of this book comes from the fact that Harari applies his vast knowledge of the human history to evaluate how much change has occurred in the past. By understanding that several paradigm shifts have occurred, this allows him to approach the future with great imagination. The timespan of the future he predicts is unclear but the future he describes feels believable and possible.</p>

    <p>My greatest take away from this book is the discussion about the role that human emotions play in our lives. Emotions are clearly a large part of being human (including other animals that experience emotions). How emotions influence our actions and our way of living was an entertaining. Often times I feel controlled by my emotions, and to think about a future where we can alter our emotions and as a result our desires, brings up many questions. It would make me a much more productive person but is that what I really want?</p>

    <p>It's also refreshing to see Harari argue so strongly how theist religions of the past are outdated for our society today. Like Sapiens, this book does give me an opportunity to rethink about the values and expectations that I live with today, and how they are not necessarily objective truths.</p>

    <p>As in Sapiens, Harari manages to touch upon multitudes of disciplines from philosophy to psychology to physics, biology, and to the arts. The first sections of the book feel like a summary of Sapiens, but he reintroduces his main arguments with new examples. This does serve as a great way to be refreshed about past ideas.</p>

        <h1>James Dyson - Against the Odds</h1>
        <h2>James Dyson</h2>
        <h3>April 30, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is James Dyson's autobiography. He tells us his journey that led him to producing the world's first bag-less vacuum cleaner.</p>

    <p>I find Dyson's dedication to building his prototype incredible. Even more impressive is how much work it took for him to bring his working prototype into production. In hindsight it is so obvious that Dyson created a beautiful and innovative invention that would have a great market. But the big companies and investors all failed to see the value in Dyson's invention even though it was built and demonstrated right in front of their eyes. This is quite scary and shows that often times creating something great is not enough. You need to have enough energy and faith in your creation in order to keep convincing people (life Dyson). At least in his story, it is ridiculous how much resistance people have against anything that is new.</p>

    <p>Another thing that surprised me are the number of law suits that Dyson had to go through. It seems like the big corporates bully and harass him. So much effort is wasted in trying to bring Dyson down instead of concentrating time and money into making newer, better things. It's a huge waste of time. Dyson also has a strong opinion against how advertising agencies are also a huge waste of money.</p>

    <p>Dyson is very clearly opinionated, and although I disagree with some of the things he says (for example to draws a clear boundary between creatives and non-creatives, or makes claims that non-creative people are jealous of creative people, etc.) but they are still worthwhile to read and think about.</p>

    <p>It was an inspiring story to read about how much effort it took Dyson to get his product into the consumer and how important it is to be persistent with your goals and dreams. He was very brave and crazy enough to believe in his idea and push it into the market.</p>

        <h1>難しいことはわかりませんが、お金の増やし方を教えてください！</h1>
        <h2>Hajime Yamazaki and Kosuke Ohashi</h2>
        <h3>March 23, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This book is a conversation between Ohashi, who is a novice at investing, and Yamazaki who is a veteran in finance. Ohashi asks Yamazaki very basic questions about investing and Yamazaki answers them as honestly and straightforward as possible.</p>

    <p>This book is far more practical than <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>. Graham's book is more about the right investing mindset rather than specific financial products.  On the other hand, this book is incredibly practical. Yamazaki describes exactly which financial products to buy and goes as far as showing the steps of how to register an account at online brokerages and buy the products discussed.</p>

    <p>The book mainly recommends index funds and government bonds. Yamazaki also makes it very clear which financial products to stay away from. For example, large retail banks in Japan run many TV ads for their fund wrap products. Yamazaki makes a very strong point to stay away from these products since returns are minimized because of the high costs of running advertisements, having commercial retail spaces, and high salaries of bankers. Instead, Yamazaki recommends readers to buy most financial products through online brokerages, since their overall expenses for running the business is lower, so investors can expect higher returns.</p>

    <p>A lot of the discussion is Japan-specific. NISA is brought up many times, which is a tax exemption scheme in Japan to encourage more people to invest. Also, some chapters don't concern investing directly. For example, there is some discussion about the financial benefits of marrying, or whether you should have life insurance, and what kind of life insurance makes the most sense financially. There is also a chapter discussing whether you should rent or buy your own house.</p>

    <p>Ohashi's naive questions makes the book approachable to the ordinary reader while Yamazaki's expertise brings credibility and clarity to the answers given. This was a very light book to read, especially after reading <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>.</p>

        <h1>The Intelligent Investor</h1>
        <h2>Benjamin Graham</h2>
        <h3>March 18, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is the first book about investing I’ve read. Graham teaches the readers the philosophy and techniques about value investing. A lot of the book is about having the right attitude towards investing.</p>

    <p>Graham makes a strong distinction between investors and speculators. Often, people think that they are investing when they are merely speculating. Although Graham does not deny that speculators can make great returns at times, he also makes the claim that in the long term, speculators usually end up losing more money than the “intelligent investor”.</p>

    <p>My technical knowledge of investing is limited. I do not have an intuitive understanding of concepts like “earnings per share” or different types of bonds. For this reason, a lot of the technical chapters of the book were very difficult for me to read. At the same time, the chapters about general investment philosophies were easy to understand. I think that if someone with a technical knowledge of investing reads the book, they may have a lot to gain from it.</p>

    <p>Graham is realistic and empathetic about understanding what kind of investor you are. The biggest distinction he makes is between the “Defensive Investor” and the “Enterprising Investor”. He does not make a claim that one is superior to the other but instead makes a distinction based on how much of a commitment you are willing to put into your investments. If you don’t enjoy reading financial reports and doing research for picking the right stocks, he respects that and gives proper advice towards that kind of investor.</p>

    <p>The revised edition of The Intelligent Investor includes commentaries written by Jason Zweig, a finance journalist after every chapter. For chapters that are unclear because of Graham’s writing style or technical lingo, Zweig summarizes in a manner that is easy to understand. In addition, he also adds a modern interpretation to Graham’s writing. Since the original book was written in 1973, to a novice reader like myself, it is unclear if the numbers or the philosophy that Graham talks about is still relevant in today’s market. Zweig’s commentaries and footnotes let me know if something is out of date, or if specific market conditions have changed. The commentary felt very necessary for me to read the book without being worried how relevant Graham’s writing still is.</p>

    <p>I’m glad that I read this book at an early age before I begin investing any money. This book has motivated me to look at the market in the long term, and makes you realize how much the market fluctuates over long periods. Since I am still young, I don’t need to concentrate on making quick returns. Zweig talks quite a bit about how things went out of hand during the dot-com bubble. Since I didn’t live though the dot-com bubble, I found it quite fascinating to read about what happened there, and I feel educated for when another bubble comes.</p>

    <p>There are three ideologies that stuck with me the most. First, the ideology that just because the market declines, you need to sell your stocks. Second, that when there is a “growth stock” it actually makes the stock more dangerous to invest in it since there’s a greater chance that it is overvalued due to the high enthusiasm of the market. Thirdly, that it is very difficult to recover from huge losses, so you want to avoid that as much as possible.</p>

    <p>On a side note, Graham dedicates a chapter to the dangers of inflation. I recently visited an audio company and they had on display an old record player from decades ago. The price of the record player was 35 yen. It’s scary to think that there was a time it was possible to buy a fancy record player for 1/3 the price of a notebook.</p>

    <p><i>The Intelligent Investor</i> took quite a long time for me to read, and some parts were quite tough for me to get through. Overall I feel it was a necessary book for me to read and I’m glad that I got through it. Now that I have a general understanding of the value investing mindset, I would like to read more technical books investing next.</p>

        <h1>Digital Gold</h1>
        <h2>Nathaniel Popper</h2>
        <h3>February 1, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Digital Gold</i> is a story about the creation of Bitcoin from a historic and cultural perspective, as opposed to a technical standpoint. I did not expect much before reading this book but the content was incredibly captivating, and provided a great summary of the development of Bitcoin. I’ve only become acquainted with Bitcoin in the past few years but this book tells a story starting in 2009. Prior to reading <i>Digital Gold</i> I had no idea what Bitcoin was about other than all the speculation that was happening with its prices.</p>

    <p>It seems like people with anarchistic motives and ideologies drove the beginnings of Bitcoin. Although the beginning years potentially sounded like a startup in its early phases, it seemed more about spreading a belief and an ideology. Like any other currency, Bitcoin needed its users to have trust in it. In order to spread the Bitcoin, the early adopters needed people to believe in it at an ideological level. The early years of the Bitcoin story is filled with such passionate people who did this with no intention of becoming rich. I find this passion incredibly inspiring. Reading about so many people who were excited by the new possibilities has made me excited as well.</p>

    <p>The truth is, I still don’t quite understand the true powers of Bitcoin and the blockchain, but I am filled with excitement about it now, and want to read more about the subject. The book repeatedly quotes people who claim that the Bitcoin is like the Internet when the Internet first came out. Even to this day, people are still finding new ways of embracing Internet. If Bitcoin really is the “next internet” I really do want to understand what its all about. There are probably lots of projects that are low hanging fruit and I would like to be able to understand this enough to identify these opportunities.</p>

    <p>Finally there is one quote that stuck with me about the relationship between Bitcoin and blockchain. Wences Casares, one of the leading Bitcoin entrepreneurs said, “The desire to use the blockchain without Bitcoin was like somebody wanting to have a website without using the Internet.” (p. 365) There is something about this quote that fascinates me, and makes me realize that I know so little about this new technology.</p>

    <p>I decided to read this book because I had Professor Allen as my economics professor during my last semester in university. Reading the book reminded me of many of the concepts that we discussed in class, most notably the relationship between high wages and inventions as well as the importance of investigating the historical prices of different goods to tell economic stories.</p>

    <p>The book discusses the different types of economic development that took place from the 18th century onwards in different parts of the world. Professor Allen first introduces what is known as the Great Divergence, why the west experienced tremendous economic growth while the rest of the countries were left behind. The ‘standard model’ of industrialization is described, which includes the four policies that effect banking, tariffs, education, and transport. Throughout the book we see how these four policies were successfully or unsuccessfully applied to different countries over the past four centuries.</p>

    <p>I found the chapter about the economic growth of Africa particularly interesting. The chapter starts off explaining, “Colonial ideology persists in some Western circles, where the poverty of Africans is attributed to their imagined laziness of lack of intelligence. ” (p.91) Instead of conforming to these types of stereotypical explanations, Professor Allen attempts to give a purely economic explanation to why economic growth did not reach the levels of Western counterparts. Some of the reasons include aftereffects from colonial rule, high transportation costs to Europe, as well as having too much land, which prevented a series of developments from having to taking place. A whole chapter is dedicated to this mystery about African growth and goes quite in depth.</p>

    <p>In addition to chapters about Africa, there is also emphasis on China, Japan, and Russia, as examples of countries that successfully adopted the standard model and also were able to catch up to the West due to careful policy planning for the “Big Push” industrialization. Although I take for granted the current state of Japan, the book makes it clear that exuberant amounts of investments and planning needed to be made in order to transform the country into a modern industrial economy. The success is a result of a long-term project, and I find that kind of future planning inspiring and respectable. Although most people never get to engage in state planning of that scale, it is quite fascinating to read about it and to get a glimpse of the complexity behind it.</p>

The book has made me feel that the causes of inequality are much more complicated than I expected, and that it feels like a product of circumstances more than anything.</p>

    <p>My main criticism about the book is that some of the graphs are hard to read since the keys are often similar.</p>

    <p>I was at the <a href="https://www.balmuda.com/jp/" target="_blank">Balmuda</a> section inside <a href="http://real.tsite.jp/futakotamagawa/english/" target="_blank">Tsutaya Electronics</a> at Futakotamagawa when I saw this magazine on display as a part of promoting the Balmuda products. The magazine was quite beat up since it had been on display for a very long time but I decided to buy the copy never the less.</p>

    <p>This is the first AXIS issue I’ve read. Although the issue was published over 6 months ago, the content did not feel out of date. The main subject was about companies and people that are combining Business, Technology, and Creativity (BTC). In addition the top story was about Balmuda’s founder Gen Terao and his story about the company. I found most of the stories quite fresh and inspiring. One of the articles I found inspiring was on Lena Okajima who founded ALE. <a href="http://star-ale.com/en/" target="_blank">ALE</a> is a Japanese startup attempting to launch satellites to create artificial shooting stars. The story about Balmuda was also inspiring. I learned that Terao used to be a musician and studied industrial design by himself.</p>

    <p>The great part about AXIS is that all of the Japanese articles come translated in English as well. Since the translations are not perfect and sometimes abbreviated, I read most of the articles in Japanese and English to get the most out of each story. I enjoyed the magazine and would love to read future issues as well. It is a great way to get a digest of people and organizations working on innovative design projects.</p>

        <h1>Cosmic Atlas (宇宙の地図)</h1>
        <h2>Eiichirō Kokubo and Miyama Shōken</h2>
        <h3>January 5, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Two astronomers from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan wrote <i>Cosmic Atlas</i>. The concept of the book is very similar to the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)" target="_blanl"><i>Powers of Ten</i></a> by <i>Charles and Ray Eames</i>. We start off at an aerial view of the National Astronomical Observatory in Mitaka, Tokyo and start zooming out in multiples an order of magnitude of 10. We see the Earth, then nearby planets, and eventually out into the whole Cosmos.</p>

    <p>The book is packed with beautiful photos and illustrations of the cosmos. Unlike Carl Sagan’s <i>Cosmos</i>, the book has many illustrations but very little writing. It is a book for “seeing” rather than “reading”. The illustrations are colorful and stunning, and made me imagine what else is out there. The photos range from planets, individual stars, nebulas, and to galaxies. Although the illustrations and photographs were static snapshots in time, I was curious to see how they would look like in motion. Although it would take millions and billions of years to see significant changes in the shapes of the galaxies, I was curious to see this movement in fast motion. To imagine that these astronomical entities change shape over time makes them seem like living organisms.</p>

        <h1>Cosmos</h1>
        <h2>Carl Sagan</h2>
        <h3>January 5, 2018</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Cosmos</i> takes us on an adventure though the history of the cosmos, how galaxies where made, where atoms came from, the creation of stars and planets, and how living creatures like humans came to be. Sagan puts Earth and humans in perspective of the cosmos.</p>

    <p><i>Cosmos</i> makes you realize how tiny Earth is when compared to the vastness of everything else out there. In fact, the cosmos is so vast that it even makes our Milky Way seems so small and insignificant. We are small not only physically, but also existed for a short amount of time. In the 14 billion year history of the cosmos, humans have only existed for less than 200,000 years (>0.001% of the existence of the cosmos). Not only are we small, but also we are so young.</p>

    <p>The book is written in a way that an average reader can appreciate and understand the beauty of the cosmos. With that said, I felt that some prior knowledge of space and science would help readers appreciate the concepts more. Although explanations are given, it is hard to digest everything when there are lots of new concepts introduced. For example, there are parts of the book where Sagan delves into the molecular composition of different planets and stars. Since my background in Chemistry is limited, it was rather difficult for me to appreciate those sections and I felt that a lot of what I was reading didn’t register in me.</p>

    <p>The beauty of the book is that it not only concentrates on the science behind cosmos but also takes historical, anthropological, and theological points of views. For example when Sagan examines the possible origins of the cosmos, he makes references to different religions and how scientific explanations may in fact be not much different from many religious creation narratives.</p>

    <p>Reading stories of before the Earth was circumnavigated made me imagine how exciting and scary travel must have been. There were many brave adventurers who sailed the seas to uncover the unknown. With no more “undiscovered” parts left on Earth it is quite clear that if humans still have an inkling of adventure left in them, the next destination would be into space. Sagan talks from his own experiences from the Viking and Voyager missions about people attempting to make these new explorations.</p>

    <p>I personally loved the last three chapters titled “The Persistence of Memory”, “Encyclopedia Galactica”, and “Who Speaks for Earth”. After we are told our place in the cosmos, Sagan discusses the unique qualities of humans and how we are at critical point in our history where we are fully capable of annihilating ourselves through nuclear war. If this happens, it means that our species would not have been able to survive long enough to discover or be discovered by extraterrestrial life. In addition, Sagan talks about the odds of there actually being extraterrestrial life, and how the human species should be dealing with that.</p>

    <p>The possibility of there being life out there is exciting. But I personally think that humans may still lack the maturity to properly interact with them. How can we expect ourselves to treat extraterrestrial life forms with respect, when we cannot treat other species of animals on Earth properly and moreover, treat other humans fairly.</p>

    <p>When compared to <i>Sapiens</i>, this book is much more scientific and less speculative. I do feel that the underlying spirit of the books is similar, in that they attempt to place humans in perspective of time and space.</p>

    <p>My biggest criticism for the book is that I wish it had more accompanying diagrams and photos. A lot of the new concepts were incredibly foreign to me so I was very curious to actually see what Sagan was describing. For example Sagan talks about a large radio telescope called the Very Large Array. I had to imagine what it looked like until I had the Internet to look it up.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> <i>Cosmos</i> is a book about the history of the cosmos, galaxies, stars, planets, as well as origins of life on Earth. Sagan also goes into the history of the study of astronomy, possibilities of extraterrestrial life, and our brief history as humans.</p>

        <h1>Branded Interactions</h1>
        <h2>Marco Spies</h2>
        <h3>December 1, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Branded Interactions</i> is about the intersection of branding and design. Spies describes how a unique and cohesive user experience is vital in order to create a strong brand in today’s digital world. My understanding of branding prior to reading this book was of corporate visual identities (including colors, typography, logo). Spies has expanded my understanding and appreciation of branding to a new level.</p>

    <p>Users now have more opportunities to come in contact with a brand than ever before. This includes websites, emails, apps, interactive installations, hardware, etc…. Each of these “brand touchpoints” must be understood and designed appropriately to supplement a given brand. This means that a brand should have cohesive gestures, navigation systems, and levels of complexities. Even if they are not identical across mediums, all interactions should be in line with the brand strategy.</p>

    <p>The books takes you through a 5 step process of “discovery”, “define”, “design”, “deliver”, “distribute” to give a full overview of how a design team may tackle a branded interaction design project.</p>

    <p>Here is an overview of the 5 sections.</p>

    <p><i>Discovery</i>: Techniques for understanding the client, client’s business, users, and their existing brand. Strategies for interviewing stakeholders, analyzing users, understanding the evaluating the brand, evaluating competitors, and defining project goals are given. The discovery stage is about setting up the project so that it is headed towards the right direction. This is the “research” phase of the project.</p>

    <p><i>Define</i>: Based on the findings from the discovery stage a tangible strategy is created. This means mapping our user journeys, positing the brand within the market, planning a user experience, and defining metrics for success.</p>

    <p><i>Design</i>: The design phase is actually about generating ideas, creating wireframes, wireflows, storyboards, and prototyping different designs. This is the actual creation of a design/product based on the “discovery” and “design” phases.</p>

    <p><i>Deliver</i>: This stage is about getting ready for launching the design and product created in the “design” phase. There is a lot of emphasis on creating style guides, both visual and UX guides for the client for when the project gets handed over to a different team.</p>

    <p><i>Distribute</i>: Everything that happens after the launch. This includes measuring KPIs and techniques for a successful debriefing session. Techniques for keeping the brand alive and adaptive are also given. This means having protocols to help new employees understand the brand, but also making sure that the brand gets refined and optimized overtime.</p>

    <p>This book is incredibly practical from how to take notes, team management techniques, team composition, presentation tips, maintaining client relationships, and also setting appropriate metrics for success. The section I appreciated the most was section 3.2 about generating ideas. Spies gives ideas for idea generation and lists good practices based on his experiences of what worked and didn’t work for him in the past. One major practicality that the book leaves out is about pricing/financing strategies for the projects.</p>

    <p>There are several sections of interviews conducted with various designers. Each designer brings a different perspective from his or her previous work. Some interviews lean towards UX and others towards branding. These interviews are refreshing to read in-between the chapters.</p>

    <p>My main criticism for the book is about the graphics that accompany many of the concepts. Often times they are over simplified and feel like they were over designed for the sake design and add confusion (Tufte would not approve of many of the diagrams). Also there are several invented terms and frameworks that may be unfamiliar to most readers.</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b>: How to conduct a successful a branded interaction design (BIxD) project from start to finish. The book is a practical guide to BIxD but also introduces readers to the field and describes why it is important to brands today.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts</b>: Branded Interaction Design (BIxD), wireflows, hierarchy of needs, multiscreen strategies, brand touchpoints, UX style guide, 6-3-5 method for idea generation</p>

        <h1>Visual Explanations</h1>
        <h2>Edward Tufte</h2>
        <h3>November 25, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Similar to <i>Envisioning Information</i>, <i>Visual Explanations</i> is filled with a vast range of examples throughout history and cultures. With that said some of the chapters were confusing and lacked the clarity that <i>Envisioning Information</i> maintained throughout the entire book. The most confusing of them all was the chapter about visual confections. Tufte describes confections as bringing images together to display visual information as opposed to collages, which combine images to create provoking images (art). Tufte attempts to explain the distinction, but without clarity.</p>

    <p>The best chapter of the book is Chapter 2 which goes into extreme detail about one case when information design worked and another case when information design failed. The two examples are from the Cholera Epidemic in London in 1854 and the Space Shuttle Challenger O-ring leak. This chapter is self-contained and should be read by anyone that works with any form of statistics or data visualization. This chapter is not only for people that create visualizations but also for people that read any form of data. Minor tweaks to data visualization can change the entire story so it is important to know these techniques so that one can protect themselves from exploitation (and exploit when necessary).</p>

    <p>There is a chapter dedicated to Parallelism and also in multiples. These techniques are familiar from <i>Envisioning Information</i> but Tufte does a good job of keeping the examples fresh. Also similar to <i>Envisioning Information</i>, one of my most enjoyable moments are when Tufte does a before/after of poor design. These examples help make his principles very clear and prove that they are effective. I found his redesign of cloud animations and aggregation of clinical psychiatric data quite fascinating.</p>

    <p>One chapter is dedicated to visualization of magic tricks. This chapter is strange because first we examine techniques successful magic visualization uses (eg. multiple diagrams in time-sequences, overlapping diagrams, etc.). The chapter moves onto common tricks of deception used in magic (eg. large motions distract from small motions). These techniques of deception are then inverted to talk about positive techniques that can be used to not confuse people. The transition of the chapter from magic diagrams to illusion as a concept was very strange and confusing to me.</p>

    <p>The strange thing about the redesigns, or in fact for any great design are that it makes it seem like there was always a single definitive “best” way to solve a problem. Of course these solutions always seem trivial in afterthought. I think becoming a great designer means to always be able to find a better solution, and to have the capabilities of being able to improve what is already great.</p>

    <p>Although the overall narrative of the book is unclear at times, each of the examples are unique and beautiful. If the reader can form their own interpretations or learnings from them, the book can serve as a great reference for inspiration.</p>

    <p><b>Summary: </b>Tufte shares with us a range of techniques to be able to tell clear effective visual stories of information (data). The book is filled with examples of good designs and explanations of what makes them effective.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts: </b>disinformation design, visual confections, parallelism, bureaucratic structures on computer screen, masking, chart junk</p>

        <h1>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</h1>
        <h2>Matthew Frederick</h2>
        <h3>November 23, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</i> is a short book about attitudes and mindsets when producing architectural works. The list of “101 things” ranges from techniques (sketching, coloring) to presentation to mindsets for producing successful creative works. I think most of the concepts are applicable to other fields of creative works since many of the items are about the importance of process.</p>

    <p>You can tell some of the tips are niche for students of architecture. They are too obscure for an average reader to appreciate. For example tip #22 is “How to make architectural hand-lettering” and explains how to make your handwriting “architectural” style.</p>

    <p>With that said, I think a lot of the concepts which appear to be architecture specific on the surface can be use for non-architectural design. Some of the techniques mentioned in controlling the flow of people throughout a building can be utilized in UX design for screens. Tip #87 is about placing anchors (elements that inherently attract people). By strategically placing anchors that people move between, users can get exposed to and acquainted with everything placed in between. Movement of people can be substituted with movement of the eye.</p>

    <p>I wish the book had more detail and examples, but that would change the purpose of the book. It’s a good book for quick inspiration and reminder for principles.</p>

    <p><b>Summary: </b> List of 101 techniques, philosophies, and attitudes that an architecture student learns. It is a quick and fun read.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts: </b>counterpoint, parti, anchors, solid-void theory</p>

        <h1>Zero to One - Notes on startups, or how to build the future</h1>
        <h2>Peter Thiel</h2>
        <h3>November 15, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Zero to One</i> makes a point that a lot of the developed world lives with an “indefinitely optimistic” attitude. This means that people feel optimistic about the future but without any definite plans regarding how to achieve that. He makes a point that under this kind of mindset, individuals are likely to make decisions that do not create new wealth.</p>

    <p>I feel that the book is great pep talk, but overall it feels like a lot of rambling and heavily opinionated rather than a book written based on years of research and analysis. With that said Thiel has been a part lot of many successful tech startups, and continues to be one of the most influential players so there is a lot to be gained from his intuition and the way he identifies valuable startups. He does make some more constructive and practical advise about starting startups with a partner, or some good philosophies regarding the characteristics of a successful founder.</p>

    <p>This is one of the few business books I read. It’s refreshing to hear some new and radical perspectives. Some of the points are very practical like lists of criteria that a successful startup must take into account (e.g. groundbreaking technology, having a “secret”, etc…). Thiel does dedicate a chapter to the importance of sales and distribution, which was a good reminder that creating a beautiful product is not enough. Some of the more macro thoughts regarding the creation of companies and maintaining a long-term vision seem like important things that a successful entrepreneur must take into account.</p>

    <p>Some of the philosophies regarding successful startups such “own a monopoly” or “know a secret” are good attitudes to approach life as an individual too. It’s great to be the best at something and great to live for values that you alone believe in.</p>


    <p><b>Summary: </b>A book that describes the qualities and attitudes that a successful VC-backed tech startup must take into account.</p>

        <h1>Hello Design Thinking</h1>
        <h2>IDEO U</h2>
        <h3>November 12, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Hello Design Thinking</i> is not a book but an online course offered by the design firm IDEO as an introduction to design thinking.</p>

    <p>The course takes about 90 minutes to complete, and is done all in the browser. The course switches between short video lessons and online activities. For the activities, students are presented with a hypothetical project, and then asked to come up with design ideas to complete the project.</p>

    <p>IDEO divides the course into the 4 sections of Gather Inspiration, Generate Ideas, Make Ideas Tangible, and Share the Story. For each section, they gives us examples of how IDEO approached some of their own client work and shares their techniques and insights with us. For example, in the section of “Generate Ideas” one of the activities is to come up with different ideas of unrelated subjects, and then mixing and matching them to create “innovative”, “out of the box” ideas.</p>

    <p>I do think that this course is a great introduction and a fresh way of thinking for individuals who are not acquainted to this type of work. Design thinking is trendy and IDEO is one of the leading companies behind the movement so I thought that is would be worthwhile to understand their interpretation of the process.</p>

    <p>With that said, I do think that most of the concepts are quite basic for people who have already explored design thinking before. The course is rather expensive ($199 for 90 day access) and for that price you could buy 4 or 5 great books about design. The most valuable parts for me were hearing about actual projects that IDEO completed and how they approached them. This felt like insights that were unique to this course. If someone wants to quickly learn what the process is about, and can expense the course to their company, it may be a fun course to quickly take.</p>

    <p>Since this was the first time I’ve ever bought an online course, I was curious to see how it was implemented, and what the experience feels like. Since the course was advertised as a 90 minutes course, I expected 90 minutes of video, but in reality they had 16 short videos and the rest of the 90 minutes was time for “activities”. I am curious to see how their multi-week courses are structured.</p>

    <p>At the end of the course I received a “design thinking toolkit” which is a 9 page PDF that is a template to walk someone through IDEO’s design thinking process. It is a nice PDF to have but I am also concerned that the process is overly systematized when it is presented like this. If an individual strictly follows this template they may be unable to break out of when necessary, which could cause produce nonoptimal results.</p>

        <h1>The Elements of Typographic Style (version 4.2)</h1>
        <h2>Robert Bringhurst</h2>
        <h3>November 10, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Bringhurst writes to you as if you are a professional. He does not spend time explaining basic typographic concepts from scratch (its not an introductory book). He goes straight to the facts and details so the book can feel heavy at times if you haven’t been exposed to some of these ideas before (or at least thought about them). Bringhurst talks about everything related to typography in extreme detail from its history to its technicalities. The book is not only factual but also approaches typography in a poetic and philosophical manner.</p>

    <p>There is so much substance in the book that answers all the questions that I’ve ever had regarding typography. For example, Bringhurst writes clear rules about whether or not periods (“.”) and commas (“,”) should be included when you are bolding or italicizing text. This is something that I’ve always wondered about.</p>

    <p>Two things really stood out to me that made this book special. First was the amount of typographic history the book contains. By approaching typography from a historical context from when type was casted on metal, it makes you appreciate old decisions made in initial typographic design. Concepts like “leading” and “kerning” can be appreciated more in the context of metal typefaces. Another thing that stood out to me was how international the scope of the book was. He brings into discussion fonts and characters that are non-Latin, especially Cyrillic and Greek characters. There is also a lot of discourse about the right way to approach characters with diacritics that are not used in the traditional English keyboard as å, ä, ă, and â. Diacritics often get neglected when foreign words enter English text.</p>

    <p>One key takeaway was the attitude Bringhurst takes in the importance of tailoring the font to your needs. He has a strong assumption that there is no “perfect” font out there and that every font has space for improvement. He encourages tasks that would seem daunting to the average user such as fixing kerning tables or adding special characters that may not be included in the package.</p>

    <p>By studying typography from a historical context, you realize how carefully crafted the act of typesetting used to be as opposed to now. Today with everyone using word processors on computers, so much of typesetting has become automated and a mindless act. Word processors also give us the tools and power to easily tamper with type, which more often than not causes the average user to make catastrophic decisions. This book makes you realize that there are too many type-crimes around us.</p>

    <p>In a world where so many fonts are available online, Bringhurst brings a great attitude that we should focus more on the quality of fonts than quantity. Too often we end up using fonts that are poorly designed or have an incomplete set of characters. He suggests readers that its better to pick one complete (or almost complete) typefaces, and master it fully before moving onto new typefaces.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> <i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i> gives the readers deep insights into the history, use, and philosophy of typography. The scope of the book is so wide that most of the concepts discussed throughout the book can be applied to typography for any language. It makes you appreciate the intricacies and care that can be put into good typography at another dimension.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts:</b> text figures, tilting figures, ligatures, em, en, digital hints, unicameral, bicameral, slab serif, roman letter</p>

        <h1>How to Lie with Statistics</h1>
        <h2>Darrell Huff</h2>
        <h3>October 15, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>How to Lie with Statistics</i> introduces common misrepresentations of statistical data. Some of the techniques are verbal while others are graphical. For example, drawing graphs in certain ways can help exaggerate or minimize certain types of data. Huff also when, why, and how to be cautious with certain types of statistics. He makes clear why organizations may want to misrepresent data (intentionally or accidentally) and when to identify these cases.</p>

    <p>For example he would explain how different methods of sampling might produce different outcomes. By altering sampling techniques, data can be completely skewed. Without proper information about sampling techniques, certain statistics can be completely unreliable. By presenting multiple scenarios with the same data set, he makes clear the dangers of naively trusting in statistics.</p>

    <p>Although most of the examples in the book are more than 50 years old (as the book was written quite a while ago), the examples are straightforward and occasionally come with accompanying illustrations of graphs and charts.</p>

    <p>Reading this book after <i>Cartoon Guide to Statistics</i> made me feel I had a deeper understanding of the topics that Huff mentions. Most concepts are introduced in a more quantitative manner in <i>Cartoon Guide to Statistics</i> but <i>How to Lie with Statistics</i> takes these topics and use them to your advantage. The book is a very quick read and written in a clear manner, easy to understand even without any background of statistics.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The book gives examples of how people and organizations present statistical data in a misleading way. The book goes through basics concepts of statistics and gives examples of how data can be represented and worded in various ways to convey completely different messages. Techniques range from visual representations of data (graphs, illustrations) to wording of data (mean, average, statistical “euphemism”). This book can be read to protect oneself against common tactics of statistical misrepresentations.</p>

        <h1>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics</h1>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I decided to read this book in attempt to gain a general understanding of the field of statistics. Prior to reading this book I had close to no understanding of statistics.</p>

    <p>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics attempts to take the reader through several fundamental concepts of statistics. It goes though fundamental topics such as normal distribution (a lot of normal distribution), confidence intervals, probability, sampling, standard deviation, p-values, t-distribution, hypothesis testing, and regression. These are all terms that I was unfamiliar prior to reading the book. I feel like I have a general understanding of these terms and what they represent. I do think that one of the main takeaways for me was the power of random selection and how proper sampling techniques can lead to normal distribution of data. The “comic” does a successful job of conveying the power and beauty of normal distribution.</p>

    <p>The book describes statistics from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint. Qualitatively, the viewer is described the importance of randomization, or different techniques for successful experimental design. These topics are much more accessible to the reader without a statistics education. On the other hand, most of the concepts are also described qualitatively through various equations. Some equations are rather trivial, and most are straightforward, but there are several examples where the derivation of equations is unclear. In addition, even if the equations and their meaning can be understood, I do not feel that I can apply these equations, or solve real statistics problems (nor do I think that the book is intended for that). With that said, I think the concise nature of the comic can serve as a good review for students with a proper statistics background.</p>

    <p>By going through topics quickly, I feel I was exposed to a wide range of topics quickly. I do feel a new appreciation for statistics after realizing its power and importance. Unfortunately most sections do lack depth and require additional sources to get a true understanding of them. For example, half a page is dedicated for box-and-whiskers plots. It explained the technicalities of them, but not enough information about the interpretations of different datasets represented as box-and-whiskers plots. The introduction to t-distributions was also too short to understand fully their significance. </p>

    <p>The illustrations are sometimes deceiving making certain topics seems much lighter than they are. In addition they add confusion, as the dialogue is irrelevant to the material so effort must be made to decipher its importance. The comics do keep the reading entertaining though (sometimes very smart jokes). Reading several chapters multiple times helped me understand the content much better. The comic-style of the book makes sometimes tempts you to rush through the pages but reading at a textbook pace is necessary for many of the more sophisticated sections.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A quick overview of the subject of statistics in comic format. The book gives several statistics concepts through straightforward examples. There are several quantitative explanations of the concepts through equations, which may serve as a simple reference guide for students for statistics.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts:</b> Expected values. Confidence intervals, Standard deviation, z-scores, t-distributions, hypothesis testing, Type-I/II error, p-values</p>

        <h1>Envisioning Information</h1>
        <h2>Edward R. Tufte</h2>
        <h3>October 4, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Envisioning Information is an inspirational book of how much love can be given to a seemingly dull subject. Tufte gives us ingenious examples of how multidimensional data has been represented on paper by different people in different subject areas throughout time. We see similar recurring strategies that are used for completely unrelated datasets. Tufte takes the reader on a journey, comparing and studying different data visualization strategies used.</p>

    <p>The best moments in the book are when Tufte gives bad examples of design, then presents us with a fixed version. He articulates the differences very clearly for the reader. Although the changes seem trivial and obvious (once presented with), the differences are stark. You can really tell the difference between work that someone “just doing their job” created opposed to an artful production of seemingly boring data. Tufte does this repeatedly with timetables for trains from all around the world and from centuries ago. These range from ingenious forms of timetable presentation invented by Charles Ybry to “ordinary” timetables in the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.</p>

    <p>This book also has a fair amount of examples from Japan. The book provides English translations but I also found it entertaining to be able to read and understand a lot of the original captions on the Japanese examples.</p>

    <p>Some things must be mentioned about the physical production of the book. The typesetting and design of this book is uncomfortably perfect. All of the diagrams, images, and examples are presented in the same page as the accompanying text. In typical books, descriptions and paragraphs overflow to the following page, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to compare the text and illustrations. Text is always contained within a single spread, perfectly compartmentalizing each spread by a separate topic (unless a topic spans multiple spreads). Margins on each page are cleverly used to accompany footnotes and images. The choice of materiality for the hardcover edition is also incredible. The heavy paper used in the book makes every page feel it is filled with importance. It is the kind of paper you want to flip carefully, as not to damage the pages. This makes the physical act of flipping each page a conscious one, requiring the reader to carefully delve deeper into the book. Envisioning Information itself is a masterpiece of presenting information.</p>

    <p>Galileo’s examples of discovering Jupiter’s moons, as well as graphical train timetables were my favorite part of the book. I would love to read his other books in the future as well.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Tufte gives us examples and strategies of converting multi-dimensional data into the world of the “flatland” (2D, paper). He gives us examples throughout history where artists, scientists, statisticians, have used various techniques to represent time, space, magnitude, and other qualitative factors on paper. The book makes clear what techniques work, and what doesn’t, and includes some psychological reasoning to back theories up. The book is dense with examples and references about data visualization throughout history and industries.</p>

        <h1>Speculative Everything - Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming</h1>
        <h2>Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby</h2>
        <h3>October 1, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Speculative Everything is not only about building imaginary products for future societies. Dunne and Raby broaden the scope of speculative design much further. Speculative works can encompass not only future worlds, but also parallel worlds and improbable futures. By not concentrating on profitability, designers can be more imaginative than ever. The value of a successful speculative design project should be measured by how thought provoking it is. Imagination into other possible societies, values, and ways of living, can also give us introspection into the society we live in right now.</p>

    <p>The book also goes into more practical advice for creating speculative works. It talks about how if a speculative work were too far fetched from our current world, it would be impossible for viewers to relate to it. On the other hand, if it a design were too familiar to what we would find commercially available, it wouldn’t courage viewers to enter an imaginative state. Striking a fine line between the real and the unreal is key to a successful speculative design project.<p>

    <p>By creating works that are thought provoking of possible futures, or alternative ways of living, there is a possibility that those speculations may influence how our future with shape. The book sees speculative design as a possible catalyst for social, economic, environmental, and aesthetic change. Much of today's commercial works are bound by realistic expectations and do not allow space for imagination. Speculative design is introduced as a tool to provoke thoughts, and completely reimagining how things are.</p>

    <p>The writing is unclear and hard to follow for someone new to the field of speculative design. Unlike Sapiens, which is written for anyone, speculative everything seems to be geared towards an audience already acquainted with the field and wants more references and inspiration. Many examples of works are mentioned throughout the book but often unaccompanied with any description. Even if they are accompanied with images, they usually only have a sentence or two to accompany them making if very difficult to understand what the project is about. Perhaps information is intentionally left out to make the reader “imagine” about what the work is about.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Speculative Everything introduces us to the field of speculative design. We are introduced to speculative works in other mediums such as literature, cinema, fashion, and painting. Through this, Dunne and Raby describe the uniqueness that the field of design could bring to speculative projects. The book is filled with many examples of speculative design (mostly from their students at Royal College of Art) and examples of speculative works from other mediums. The book articulates the value of speculative works, even if they are not produced as profitable items.</p>

        <h1>Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind</h1>
        <h2>Yuval Noah Harari</h2>
        <h3>September 10, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This book gave me an opportunity to rethink what it means to be human. We have gotten so used to being “humans” that we sometimes forget that we are merely animals. Harari takes us through a journey from when Humans lived amongst other animals in the nature to our lives on modern day Earth. Reading about such past times makes you realize that so many of the rules, expectations, and mechanisms that dictate our lives today are creations of our imaginations (or myths as Harari would say).</p>

    <p>One of the main themes throughout the book is how our genetic structure has remained more of less the same since the first Homo Sapiens 150,000 years ago but how our society has evolved radically throughout history. Based on how humans use their collective imaginations, they have the power to completely change the way we live and function. The book takes a rather objective stance on various myths humans have believe with in the past. This made me think about the myths that we believe in today, and how these beliefs that make society function and not permanent nor absolute as much as they present themselves to be.<p>

    <p>One of my favorite takeaways in this book is the concept of inter-subjective truths. Unlike objective truths (eg. Gravity will attract object with a mass) and subjective truths (eg. Bob thinks that yesterday’s rain was caused by him stepping on an ant), inter-subjective truths are collective imaginations that exists in more than one body (eg. law, money, gods, nations) (ch. 6, Building Pyramids). Once you can identify something as an inter-subjective truth, it means that you can decide to believe in it or not with deliberation. This also gives you the ability to respect, empathize, and live amongst those who believe in different inter-subjective truths than yourself.</p>

    <p>It's an extremely fascinating book that's thought provoking in many ways. Great read, captivating from the first chapter.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Sapiens is a historical journey of the evolution of humans starting from when Homo Sapiens (“us”) used to live around other human speices such as Homo erectus and Homo soloensis. We are brought back to a world where we used to live amongst other animals. We follow the expansion of humans throughout the entire planet and see how we devised fictive creations to help keep order amongst our species. This book covers a wide range of topics, from religion, politics, ideologies, finance, biology, physics, law, and ethics.</p>
