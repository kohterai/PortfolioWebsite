        <h1>Visual Explanations</h1>
        <h2>Edward Tufte</h2>
        <h3>November 25, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Similar to <i>Envisioning Information</i>, <i>Visual Explanations</i> is filled with a vast range of examples throughout history and cultures. With that said some of the chapters were confusing and lacked the clarity that <i>Envisioning Information</i> maintained throughout the entire book. The most confusing of them all was the chapter about visual confections. Tufte describes confections as bringing images together to display visual information as opposed to collages, which combine images to create provoking images (art). Tufte attempts to explain the distinction, but without clarity.</p>

    <p>The best chapter of the book is Chapter 2 which goes into extreme detail about one case when information design worked and another case when information design failed. The two examples are from the Cholera Epidemic in London in 1854 and the Space Shuttle Challenger O-ring leak. This chapter is self-contained and should be read by anyone that works with any form of statistics or data visualization. This chapter is not only for people that create visualizations but also for people that read any form of data. Minor tweaks to data visualization can change the entire story so it is important to know these techniques so that one can protect themselves from exploitation (and exploit when necessary).</p>

    <p>There is a chapter dedicated to Parallelism and also in multiples. These techniques are familiar from <i>Envisioning Information</i> but Tufte does a good job of keeping the examples fresh. Also similar to <i>Envisioning Information</i>, one of my most enjoyable moments are when Tufte does a before/after of poor design. These examples help make his principles very clear and prove that they are effective. I found his redesign of cloud animations and aggregation of clinical psychiatric data quite fascinating.</p>

    <p>One chapter is dedicated to visualization of magic tricks. This chapter is strange because first we examine techniques successful magic visualization uses (eg. multiple diagrams in time-sequences, overlapping diagrams, etc.). The chapter moves onto common tricks of deception used in magic (eg. large motions distract from small motions). These techniques of deception are then inverted to talk about positive techniques that can be used to not confuse people. The transition of the chapter from magic diagrams to illusion as a concept was very strange and confusing to me.</p>

    <p>The strange thing about the redesigns, or in fact for any great design are that it makes it seem like there was always a single definitive “best” way to solve a problem. Of course these solutions always seem trivial in afterthought. I think becoming a great designer means to always be able to find a better solution, and to have the capabilities of being able to improve what is already great.</p>

    <p>Although the overall narrative of the book is unclear at times, each of the examples are unique and beautiful. If the reader can form their own interpretations or learnings from them, the book can serve as a great reference for inspiration.</p>

    <p><b>Summary: </b>Tufte shares with us a range of techniques to be able to tell clear effective visual stories of information (data). The book is filled with examples of good designs and explanations of what makes them effective.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts: </b>disinformation design, visual confections, parallelism, bureaucratic structures on computer screen, masking, chart junk</p>

        <h1>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</h1>
        <h2>Matthew Frederick</h2>
        <h3>November 23, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</i> is a short book about attitudes and mindsets when producing architectural works. The list of “101 things” ranges from techniques (sketching, coloring) to presentation to mindsets for producing successful creative works. I think most of the concepts are applicable to other fields of creative works since many of the items are about the importance of process.</p>

    <p>You can tell some of the tips are niche for students of architecture. They are too obscure for an average reader to appreciate. For example tip #22 is “How to make architectural hand-lettering” and explains how to make your handwriting “architectural” style.</p>

    <p>With that said, I think a lot of the concepts which appear to be architecture specific on the surface can be use for non-architectural design. Some of the techniques mentioned in controlling the flow of people throughout a building can be utilized in UX design for screens. Tip #87 is about placing anchors (elements that inherently attract people). By strategically placing anchors that people move between, users can get exposed to and acquainted with everything placed in between. Movement of people can be substituted with movement of the eye.</p>

    <p>I wish the book had more detail and examples, but that would change the purpose of the book. It’s a good book for quick inspiration and reminder for principles.</p>

    <p><b>Summary: </b> List of 101 techniques, philosophies, and attitudes that an architecture student learns. It is a quick and fun read.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts: </b>counterpoint, parti, anchors, solid-void theory</p>

        <h1>Zero to One - Notes on startups, or how to build the future</h1>
        <h2>Peter Thiel</h2>
        <h3>November 15, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Zero to One</i> makes a point that a lot of the developed world lives with an “indefinitely optimistic” attitude. This means that people feel optimistic about the future but without any definite plans regarding how to achieve that. He makes a point that under this kind of mindset, individuals are likely to make decisions that do not create new wealth.</p>

    <p>I feel that the book is great pep talk, but overall it feels like a lot of rambling and heavily opinionated rather than a book written based on years of research and analysis. With that said Thiel has been a part lot of many successful tech startups, and continues to be one of the most influential players so there is a lot to be gained from his intuition and the way he identifies valuable startups. He does make some more constructive and practical advise about starting startups with a partner, or some good philosophies regarding the characteristics of a successful founder.</p>

    <p>This is one of the few business books I read. It’s refreshing to hear some new and radical perspectives. Some of the points are very practical like lists of criteria that a successful startup must take into account (e.g. groundbreaking technology, having a “secret”, etc…). Thiel does dedicate a chapter to the importance of sales and distribution, which was a good reminder that creating a beautiful product is not enough. Some of the more macro thoughts regarding the creation of companies and maintaining a long-term vision seem like important things that a successful entrepreneur must take into account.</p>

    <p>Some of the philosophies regarding successful startups such “own a monopoly” or “know a secret” are good attitudes to approach life as an individual too. It’s great to be the best at something and great to live for values that you alone believe in.</p>


    <p><b>Summary: </b>A book that describes the qualities and attitudes that a successful VC-backed tech startup must take into account.</p>

        <h1>The Elements of Typographic Style (version 4.2)</h1>
        <h2>Robert Bringhurst</h2>
        <h3>November 10, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Bringhurst writes to you as if you are a professional. He does not spend time explaining basic typographic concepts from scratch (its not an introductory book). He goes straight to the facts and details so the book can feel heavy at times if you haven’t been exposed to some of these ideas before (or at least thought about them). Bringhurst talks about everything related to typography in extreme detail from its history to its technicalities. The book is not only factual but also approaches typography in a poetic and philosophical manner.</p>

    <p>There is so much substance in the book that answers all the questions that I’ve ever had regarding typography. For example, Bringhurst writes clear rules about whether or not periods (“.”) and commas (“,”) should be included when you are bolding or italicizing text. This is something that I’ve always wondered about.</p>

    <p>Two things really stood out to me that made this book special. First was the amount of typographic history the book contains. By approaching typography from a historical context from when type was casted on metal, it makes you appreciate old decisions made in initial typographic design. Concepts like “leading” and “kerning” can be appreciated more in the context of metal typefaces. Another thing that stood out to me was how international the scope of the book was. He brings into discussion fonts and characters that are non-Latin, especially Cyrillic and Greek characters. There is also a lot of discourse about the right way to approach characters with diacritics that are not used in the traditional English keyboard as å, ä, ă, and â. Diacritics often get neglected when foreign words enter English text.</p>

    <p>One key takeaway was the attitude Bringhurst takes in the importance of tailoring the font to your needs. He has a strong assumption that there is no “perfect” font out there and that every font has space for improvement. He encourages tasks that would seem daunting to the average user such as fixing kerning tables or adding special characters that may not be included in the package.</p>

    <p>By studying typography from a historical context, you realize how carefully crafted the act of typesetting used to be as opposed to now. Today with everyone using word processors on computers, so much of typesetting has become automated and a mindless act. Word processors also give us the tools and power to easily tamper with type, which more often than not causes the average user to make catastrophic decisions. This book makes you realize that there are too many type-crimes around us.</p>

    <p>In a world where so many fonts are available online, Bringhurst brings a great attitude that we should focus more on the quality of fonts than quantity. Too often we end up using fonts that are poorly designed or have an incomplete set of characters. He suggests readers that its better to pick one complete (or almost complete) typefaces, and master it fully before moving onto new typefaces.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> <i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i> gives the readers deep insights into the history, use, and philosophy of typography. The scope of the book is so wide that most of the concepts discussed throughout the book can be applied to typography for any language. It makes you appreciate the intricacies and care that can be put into good typography at another dimension.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts:</b> text figures, tilting figures, ligatures, em, en, digital hints, unicameral, bicameral, slab serif, roman letter</p>

        <h1>How to Lie with Statistics</h1>
        <h2>Darrell Huff</h2>
        <h3>October 15, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>How to Lie with Statistics</i> introduces common misrepresentations of statistical data. Some of the techniques are verbal while others are graphical. For example, drawing graphs in certain ways can help exaggerate or minimize certain types of data. Huff also when, why, and how to be cautious with certain types of statistics. He makes clear why organizations may want to misrepresent data (intentionally or accidentally) and when to identify these cases.</p>

    <p>For example he would explain how different methods of sampling might produce different outcomes. By altering sampling techniques, data can be completely skewed. Without proper information about sampling techniques, certain statistics can be completely unreliable. By presenting multiple scenarios with the same data set, he makes clear the dangers of naively trusting in statistics.</p>

    <p>Although most of the examples in the book are more than 50 years old (as the book was written quite a while ago), the examples are straightforward and occasionally come with accompanying illustrations of graphs and charts.</p>

    <p>Reading this book after <i>Cartoon Guide to Statistics</i> made me feel I had a deeper understanding of the topics that Huff mentions. Most concepts are introduced in a more quantitative manner in <i>Cartoon Guide to Statistics</i> but <i>How to Lie with Statistics</i> takes these topics and use them to your advantage. The book is a very quick read and written in a clear manner, easy to understand even without any background of statistics.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> The book gives examples of how people and organizations present statistical data in a misleading way. The book goes through basics concepts of statistics and gives examples of how data can be represented and worded in various ways to convey completely different messages. Techniques range from visual representations of data (graphs, illustrations) to wording of data (mean, average, statistical “euphemism”). This book can be read to protect oneself against common tactics of statistical misrepresentations.</p>

        <h1>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics</h1>
        <h2>Larry Gonick & Woollcott Smith</h2>
        <h3>October 8, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I decided to read this book in attempt to gain a general understanding of the field of statistics. Prior to reading this book I had close to no understanding of statistics.</p>

    <p>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics attempts to take the reader through several fundamental concepts of statistics. It goes though fundamental topics such as normal distribution (a lot of normal distribution), confidence intervals, probability, sampling, standard deviation, p-values, t-distribution, hypothesis testing, and regression. These are all terms that I was unfamiliar prior to reading the book. I feel like I have a general understanding of these terms and what they represent. I do think that one of the main takeaways for me was the power of random selection and how proper sampling techniques can lead to normal distribution of data. The “comic” does a successful job of conveying the power and beauty of normal distribution.</p>

    <p>The book describes statistics from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint. Qualitatively, the viewer is described the importance of randomization, or different techniques for successful experimental design. These topics are much more accessible to the reader without a statistics education. On the other hand, most of the concepts are also described qualitatively through various equations. Some equations are rather trivial, and most are straightforward, but there are several examples where the derivation of equations is unclear. In addition, even if the equations and their meaning can be understood, I do not feel that I can apply these equations, or solve real statistics problems (nor do I think that the book is intended for that). With that said, I think the concise nature of the comic can serve as a good review for students with a proper statistics background.</p>

    <p>By going through topics quickly, I feel I was exposed to a wide range of topics quickly. I do feel a new appreciation for statistics after realizing its power and importance. Unfortunately most sections do lack depth and require additional sources to get a true understanding of them. For example, half a page is dedicated for box-and-whiskers plots. It explained the technicalities of them, but not enough information about the interpretations of different datasets represented as box-and-whiskers plots. The introduction to t-distributions was also too short to understand fully their significance. </p>

    <p>The illustrations are sometimes deceiving making certain topics seems much lighter than they are. In addition they add confusion, as the dialogue is irrelevant to the material so effort must be made to decipher its importance. The comics do keep the reading entertaining though (sometimes very smart jokes). Reading several chapters multiple times helped me understand the content much better. The comic-style of the book makes sometimes tempts you to rush through the pages but reading at a textbook pace is necessary for many of the more sophisticated sections.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> A quick overview of the subject of statistics in comic format. The book gives several statistics concepts through straightforward examples. There are several quantitative explanations of the concepts through equations, which may serve as a simple reference guide for students for statistics.</p>

    <p><b>New Concepts:</b> Expected values. Confidence intervals, Standard deviation, z-scores, t-distributions, hypothesis testing, Type-I/II error, p-values</p>

        <h1>Envisioning Information</h1>
        <h2>Edward R. Tufte</h2>
        <h3>October 4, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Envisioning Information is an inspirational book of how much love can be given to a seemingly dull subject. Tufte gives us ingenious examples of how multidimensional data has been represented on paper by different people in different subject areas throughout time. We see similar recurring strategies that are used for completely unrelated datasets. Tufte takes the reader on a journey, comparing and studying different data visualization strategies used.</p>

    <p>The best moments in the book are when Tufte gives bad examples of design, then presents us with a fixed version. He articulates the differences very clearly for the reader. Although the changes seem trivial and obvious (once presented with), the differences are stark. You can really tell the difference between work that someone “just doing their job” created opposed to an artful production of seemingly boring data. Tufte does this repeatedly with timetables for trains from all around the world and from centuries ago. These range from ingenious forms of timetable presentation invented by Charles Ybry to “ordinary” timetables in the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.</p>

    <p>This book also has a fair amount of examples from Japan. The book provides English translations but I also found it entertaining to be able to read and understand a lot of the original captions on the Japanese examples.</p>

    <p>Some things must be mentioned about the physical production of the book. The typesetting and design of this book is uncomfortably perfect. All of the diagrams, images, and examples are presented in the same page as the accompanying text. In typical books, descriptions and paragraphs overflow to the following page, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to compare the text and illustrations. Text is always contained within a single spread, perfectly compartmentalizing each spread by a separate topic (unless a topic spans multiple spreads). Margins on each page are cleverly used to accompany footnotes and images. The choice of materiality for the hardcover edition is also incredible. The heavy paper used in the book makes every page feel it is filled with importance. It is the kind of paper you want to flip carefully, as not to damage the pages. This makes the physical act of flipping each page a conscious one, requiring the reader to carefully delve deeper into the book. Envisioning Information itself is a masterpiece of presenting information.</p>

    <p>Galileo’s examples of discovering Jupiter’s moons, as well as graphical train timetables were my favorite part of the book. I would love to read his other books in the future as well.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Tufte gives us examples and strategies of converting multi-dimensional data into the world of the “flatland” (2D, paper). He gives us examples throughout history where artists, scientists, statisticians, have used various techniques to represent time, space, magnitude, and other qualitative factors on paper. The book makes clear what techniques work, and what doesn’t, and includes some psychological reasoning to back theories up. The book is dense with examples and references about data visualization throughout history and industries.</p>

        <h1>Speculative Everything - Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming</h1>
        <h2>Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby</h2>
        <h3>October 1, 2017</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Speculative Everything is not only about building imaginary products for future societies. Dunne and Raby broaden the scope of speculative design much further. Speculative works can encompass not only future worlds, but also parallel worlds and improbable futures. By not concentrating on profitability, designers can be more imaginative than ever. The value of a successful speculative design project should be measured by how thought provoking it is. Imagination into other possible societies, values, and ways of living, can also give us introspection into the society we live in right now.</p>

    <p>The book also goes into more practical advice for creating speculative works. It talks about how if a speculative work were too far fetched from our current world, it would be impossible for viewers to relate to it. On the other hand, if it a design were too familiar to what we would find commercially available, it wouldn’t courage viewers to enter an imaginative state. Striking a fine line between the real and the unreal is key to a successful speculative design project.<p>

    <p>By creating works that are thought provoking of possible futures, or alternative ways of living, there is a possibility that those speculations may influence how our future with shape. The book sees speculative design as a possible catalyst for social, economic, environmental, and aesthetic change. Much of today's commercial works are bound by realistic expectations and do not allow space for imagination. Speculative design is introduced as a tool to provoke thoughts, and completely reimagining how things are.</p>

    <p>The writing is unclear and hard to follow for someone new to the field of speculative design. Unlike Sapiens, which is written for anyone, speculative everything seems to be geared towards an audience already acquainted with the field and wants more references and inspiration. Many examples of works are mentioned throughout the book but often unaccompanied with any description. Even if they are accompanied with images, they usually only have a sentence or two to accompany them making if very difficult to understand what the project is about. Perhaps information is intentionally left out to make the reader “imagine” about what the work is about.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Speculative Everything introduces us to the field of speculative design. We are introduced to speculative works in other mediums such as literature, cinema, fashion, and painting. Through this, Dunne and Raby describe the uniqueness that the field of design could bring to speculative projects. The book is filled with many examples of speculative design (mostly from their students at Royal College of Art) and examples of speculative works from other mediums. The book articulates the value of speculative works, even if they are not produced as profitable items.</p>

    <p>This book gave me an opportunity to rethink what it means to be human. We have gotten so used to being “humans” that we sometimes forget that we are merely animals. Harari takes us through a journey from when Humans lived amongst other animals in the nature to our lives on modern day Earth. Reading about such past times makes you realize that so many of the rules, expectations, and mechanisms that dictate our lives today are creations of our imaginations (or myths as Harari would say).</p>

    <p>One of the main themes throughout the book is how our genetic structure has remained more of less the same since the first Homo Sapiens 150,000 years ago but how our society has evolved radically throughout history. Based on how humans use their collective imaginations, they have the power to completely change the way we live and function. The book takes a rather objective stance on various myths humans have believe with in the past. This made me think about the myths that we believe in today, and how these beliefs that make society function and not permanent nor absolute as much as they present themselves to be.<p>

    <p>One of my favorite takeaways in this book is the concept of inter-subjective truths. Unlike objective truths (eg. Gravity will attract object with a mass) and subjective truths (eg. Bob thinks that yesterday’s rain was caused by him stepping on an ant), inter-subjective truths are collective imaginations that exists in more than one body (eg. law, money, gods, nations) (ch. 6, Building Pyramids). Once you can identify something as an inter-subjective truth, it means that you can decide to believe in it or not with deliberation. This also gives you the ability to respect, empathize, and live amongst those who believe in different inter-subjective truths than yourself.</p>

    <p>It's an extremely fascinating book that's thought provoking in many ways. Great read, captivating from the first chapter.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> Sapiens is a historical journey of the evolution of humans starting from when Homo Sapiens (“us”) used to live around other human speices such as Homo erectus and Homo soloensis. We are brought back to a world where we used to live amongst other animals. We follow the expansion of humans throughout the entire planet and see how we devised fictive creations to help keep order amongst our species. This book covers a wide range of topics, from religion, politics, ideologies, finance, biology, physics, law, and ethics.</p>
