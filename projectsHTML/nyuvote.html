<h2>NYU VOTE</h2>
<p>NYU Vote is an open source live voting platform designed to be the union of capability and simplicity. It has an ultra simple user-facing ballot interface, as well as a minimilistic admin interface.  I lead the design and coded the front-end for the user.  The target audience was 20,000 students from NYU New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai collectively.</p>
