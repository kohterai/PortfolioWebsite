          <div class="profile-testimonial">Koh brings a designer's eye and aesthetic to a broad range of projects. In my interaction with him as professor and mentor, he's brought playfulness to computer games, useful affordances and UI/UX tweaks to webapps, and energy, movement, light, and color to what otherwise would have been mundane short films. Enthusiastic about design in many silos but not yet wed to any one thing in particular, he has been an asset to any project fortunate enough to draw his interest.</div>

      <div class="greetings">Dear BCG Digital Ventures,</div>
      <div class="greeting_message">
        <p>I understand that the recruiting process is a natural victim of the the asymmetric information problem.  Since I am the only one who can verify who I truly am, I imagine it is difficult to assess whether or not any of my claims have any validity to them. I feel that it is a fundamental design problem if the seller is the only possible verifier.</p>

        <p>To overcome this, I’ve reached out to my friends, colleagues, and mentors that think I'm a great candidate for the firm and asked them to annotate pieces of the BCGDV job description with relevant anecdotes. Since space is limited, I have decided to highlight parts that I believe are most relevant to my skill set.</p>
<!-- 
        <p>I’ve also added my own annotations that can be seen by hovering over pieces of the text.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>I do hope that this sheds more light onto who I am, and how keen I am to be an Intern at BCGDV!</p> -->

          <div class="profile-testimonial">Every project I've worked with Koh, he has managed to suggest solutions to problems I didn't even realize existed. Even outside work Koh enjoys solving mental questions such as "How can MoMA have a better "coat check-in" experience?" or "How can a company better design its booth in a career fair to maximise efficiency and attendee satisfaction?" To him everything in life is a design puzzle awaiting to be solved.
